6,just starting and wondering about a piece of gear,scubadiving,"Just looking for some info about a regulator set im looking at buying as my first set. I've been looking online everywhere and i can't find much... just wondering if it's worth the money.  

I'm looking at a used (the owner said about 5 times) mares v16 scs titan first stage with mares proton xl and mares axis secondaries. It also has a mares gauge with it. He's selling the setup for a really good price with a bunch of other gear. I know it's an older set and i will need to have it serviced and looked after.  I'm getting for the equivalent of 100cad

Is it even worth considering? I'm a beginner by the way, have 10 dives in carabean water, going back to BC in Canada and will be diving in cold water now.

7,Near miss aka: the importance of making mistakes in training,scubadiving,"This story also reflects the difference between certification and being current/practiced enough to dive your cert.

I'm not an anxious person.  I spent over 10 years working in EMS and ERs.

Quick background.  I am a NAUI advanced certified SCUBA diver.  However, this was my first dive since 2017 do to having one of those ""life events"" and diving taking a back seat in my priorities.  A few weeks ago I went on vacation to the Virgin Islands with my dad and brother and we booked a bunch of SCUBA dives as well as renting gear.  Fast forward to my 2nd dive (the first was at a shallow 20ft depth reef), which was a curated dive through a dive shop.  This was a deep dive that started at 50ft and as we followed a trench it bottomed out at 90 before we started to go back to 50 and then the surface.

I was starting to get anxious before we even got in the water.  I was starting to worry about what would happen if my mask came off, I had choked on my regulator due to water up my nose before.  It was building up in my mind. and making me more anxious by the minute.  I get my gear on and fall back into the water, I'm now breaking out of anxious and into scared.  

I do a weight check and take my mask off under water.  I actually do fine breathing on the reg without it, but I am so keyed up that I dismiss the success and believe that I'll choke if it happens at depth.  I am hyperventilating on the surface, and I still have my regulator in and am sucking down my tank, I'm down 500 PSI before I even drop beneath the surface.  I take a moment to collect myself and then I dump my BC and descend. 

While descending something starts to pull my reg out of my mouth and someone grabs me at the back and starts shoving me around and grabbing my BC.  My tank had started to fall out of the bottom of my BC and the guy running the dive.  He fixes my situation and flashes me the ok.

Bye bye calm and collected, hello mounting fear.

\*\*The best mistake I made in training\*\*  I got my certification through a college elective and spent an entire semester in the pool doing all sorts of training.  One of them was jumping into the deep end with your dissembled gear and then breathe on the reg put the gear on and swim laps underwater.  

I could swim down to my gear and put it on.  I was great at musical SCUBA where the whole class ended up breathing on one tank, only one person had surfaced before the instructors got bored and ended the exercise.  But I had a hard time with this exercise because it involved jumping into the deep end with the gear and assembling underwater.  It was the noise, bubbles and chaos of the jump in that got to me, and the thought of not having a breathing supply ready.  I would eventually get to the point where I had my air on and breathing through the regulator, but I was nervous and would start to hyperventilate and feel the walls closing in on me. 

One technique I had learned in EMS was the importance of taking a breath, or a few rhythmic breaths to calm yourself.  If you are keyed up and your hands are shaking taking 20 seconds and doing a square (aka tactical) breathing technique will allow you to put yourself in a place conducive to success.  This involves inhaling to your maximum (keep the inhale force in and don't close your glottis) holding for 4 seconds and then exhaling to your minimum (again don't close your glottis) and holding for 4 seconds.

You can't ""hold"" your breathe underwater for reasons we are all familiar with.  But it's hard to pop a lung on an empty lung.  Exhaling out and keeping your exhaling force for that count of 4 won't hurt you.  So when I was there in the pool working my way into an underwater anxiety attack I did exactly that.  I forced out all of my air and held it for 4 seconds.  The result was magical, and it completely snapped me out of my anxiety, and I used it several more times as I repeated the jump assemble and breathe exercise.  I never had that problem again.

\---- Back to the Virgin Islands---

So, there I am sinking through 35 feet and the only thing going through my mind is ""I want to quit!""  I remembered the lesson I learned in SCUBA class and dumped all the air out of my lungs and held it like that.  Like magic my anxiety breaks and I am back to calm collected diver.  I then procced to have one of the best dives of my diving career.  

\---near miss---

In fact, I was so engaged with the dive that I didn't really check my gauges.  In the back of my mind I figured that since this was a guided dive we would all have the same air consumption.  It wasn't until my dive guide asked for my air then I realized I was 75 ft down and at 1000 PSI.  I surfaced early and had time to reflect on the boat while everyone else did another 15 minutes underwater.  

I'm glad nothing bad happened, and I learned a lot that day.  I quickly readjusted to SCUBA and by the end of the trip I was routinely putting in hour plus dives with air to spare."

23,Where to stay in Belize for first SCUBA trip?,scubadiving,"Hello! Hoping someone can direct me as there seem to be SO many options in Belize. 

My boyfriend and I were just PADI open water certified before Christmas, in Jamaica. We want to stay sharp and are seeing some really amazing deals for Belize later in the year; we've heard it's quite wonderful for diving, and were curious about where others would recommend beginners should stay. 

My ideal stay/resort would be: 

* Not too commercial- but inclusive would be cool, since it cuts down on time spent on food/drinks acquisition (more time for diving!) 
* Has or is near a dive shop offering both deep and shallow dives (I'm comfortable in up to 70ft but also enjoy more shallow dives). 
* Has land-based excursions available- I would love to see the jungle in Belize and some of the Mayan ruins; cenotes would be cool, too! 

I realize this seems like a very big ask, so if you had a great experience with a resort or particular caye that doesn't fit this exactly, please still let me know! Right now I am leaning to Turneffe or Caye Caulker."
24,Punctured my lung 12 years ago but I want to dive again,scubadiving,"Back in 2009 i punctured a lung. I was told to hold off from flying for 6 months while it healed, but also that I couldn’t scuba dive again. Like ever.

I was heartbroken because I’ve always loved scuba, but I’ve managed to satisfy myself with snorkeling and free diving. Still, I can’t help but wonder…

I’ve inquired at dive shops and they won’t rent me equipment because of the liability. I’ve even written to dive doctors who told me they don’t deal with patients who’ve punctured lungs. At the same time, I’ve read about other people who had punctured or collapsed lungs diving without issue once they healed up.

Does anyone here have experience or insight about this? 

Ideally, I’d love to test by replicating the pressure of diving in a hyperbaric chamber, that way I could be quickly transferred to a hospital if anything happened. Alternatively I guess I could just try diving somewhere near a hospital and hope for the best? Is that insane? 

I am not seeking medical advice - just insight from anyone who’s had a similar experience. Any resources you could point me to would also be much appreciated. 

Thanks!"

During my deep dive on my AOW course, I got myself into a panic and couldn’t slow my breathing down. I asked to abort the dive and we ascended slowly and did a safety stop etc. I then had a surface interval and I got back into the water and completed the dive on my terms. 

I know I handled the situation correctly and made the ascent slowly even though I was in a panicked state however, the situation has really stuck with me and I can feel my anxiety around diving getting worse. I know the best thing to do is get back into the water but with Christmas around the corner it’s not the ideal time. I definitely plan to get back to my local lake to complete my qualification next year.

Now I am just scared that one day I’m going to panic again, or maybe I’ll panic every time I get into the water. I know I’m being completely irrational and I have dived so many times and I am perfectly capable but my mind just jumps to these conclusions. Does anyone have any advice on how to calm my irrational anxiety so that I can ensure I remain calm on my future dives and do not allow my anxiety to put me at risk."

I'll spend Days 1-4 getting certified and Days 5-6 diving. Day 7 I won't be able to scuba since I have to wait 24 hours before flying home. 

I'm based in the US and my preference is &lt;10 hour flight. I'm a female in my 20s and complete beginner so I'm willing to splurge for a fun, resort-feel for the holidays that is also very safe / reputable.

I was thinking Turneffe Atoll in Belize. A 7-day all-inclusive dive resort is about $2500 (resort, meals, equipment, certification, dives) + extra for flights. I'll be in the pool the first 1-2 days and not diving on Day 7 (24 hours between last dive and flying home) so I'm not sure if it's worth the money. Is that a good deal? 

2 questions:

1. Should I wait to go to Belize until I'm an intermediate-advanced diver? I won't be able to do the Blue Hole. I'm wondering if I'll be missing out on the best dive sites there on this trip and should hold off on spending that much $$$ until I can really take advantage of all the dives in the area.
2. Other good dive resorts you'd recommend according to the info above? \^ thank you!!"

She hasn’t been able to do it that much now that she lives with me in Ontario but, almost all she thinks about is going back to the sea and scuba diving again. I can see it in her face when she’s missing the sea and I definitely feel at fault since she’s really only in Canada because of me. We’ve hoped to one day move out to somewhere near the ocean so that she can dive when she wants to again and maybe even find a job working under the salty water. 

That was the plan anyway, then about a month ago she had a seizure in her sleep. First time ever having a seizure in her life. Then a couple of weeks ago she had another one (again in her sleep). After getting an EEG of her head we’ve been told that she has “brain abnormalities”. This confirmed for our doctor that she has some kind of epilepsy. I don’t think I have to tell this Reddit community why that’s EXTRA bad for her, being a diver and all. Now she is absolutely devastated and is afraid that she might never be able to dive again. I can’t even describe how upset she is, diving is all she wants to do more than anything and I feel like I can’t do anything to help. 

I’m just looking for any information from anyone who may have gone through, or is going through what she is. From what I’ve found if you are off meds and haven’t had a seizure in 5 years you’re ok to dive but if they were nocturnal (which they were) then it shortens to 3 years.

I’m not looking for any medical advice just wanted to hear from anyone who’s gone through the same thing and might understand how much this sucks for her. Anything can help, Thanks so much."

I know I need botties, gloves, hood, mask that is the basic stuff my main struggle is between a semi dry and a 7mm wet suit. I'm in Ireland and so this is where I would be diving in the foreseeable future. semi dry wet suits around websites here range from as cheap as 280 euro in decathlon to 460 euro on more specialized websites. I'm a college student so I don't be drowning in cash, the club provides the rest of the equipment to you at the start of your diving journey but eventually of course I will want my own regulator jacket etc. That's a problem for future me though.

To summarize, what do you guys think for beginner diving in Ireland semi dry? or a 7mm wet suit, I could always wear a 7mm long wetsuit and then get a short one to go over too. But I don't want to find myself needing to buy a dry suit in a year or two after I spend money on a wet suit now. 

also any other beginner tips would be greatly appreciate :)"

The instructor had been trying to tell me something and was so focused on me and me on her that we didn’t realize the current had taken us up until our heads broke surface. A few hours after that I had such bad ear pain, I couldn’t sleep. Took an anti-inflammatory and it was gone by morning. However, I’ve had tinnitus since then and my ear will randomly pop throughout the day. Over the next few weeks I took my advanced course and had a quarry dive(60 ft)  and used that to test out how my ears would equalize. Was able to do that fine. But now we have a dive trip planned for Monday down upwards of 90 ft.  I’m getting nervous about my ear still popping and having tinnitus. I say ear because I’m already deaf in one ear and this is my only one left. I scheduled an apt with my doctor who referred me to an ENT because I want the all clear before I dive again (though I can’t dive on the trip bc the apt won’t be till after) but the group is pressuring me saying I’ll be fine.

Hi , I’m Moshe a scuba diver from Israel please tell me what are your thoughts about my last video.  


Sunrise Dive | Scuba Diving In The Red Sea | sunrise underwater. This time we did a sunrise dive at the Paradise site in the Red Sea in Israel. We entered the water while the sun was still hiding behind the mountains of Jordan, It's amazing to see in one dive the water turning from dark to light  And the sun's rays penetrate into the water and illuminate all the reefs around us .. It's an amazing experience that I really recommend doing !!  My recommendation: 1. It is important to plan your sunrise dive in advance,  Check at what time the sunrise begins with you and thus you can use the time to your advantage. 2. Remember to be patient and do a relatively shallow dive so that you have enough air in the tank so you can enjoy both the dark and the sunlight. 3. If possible, go to a diving site that you know well so you can plan a fun route both in the dark and in sunlight.  Hope you enjoyed the video,  until next time   dive safe

277,New A Diver's Life Video: Off the Beaten Path - Bonaire's Mangroves Short Clip,scubadiving,"The mangrove forest of Bonaire's Lac Bay. It is one of the most important habitats on the island. Mangroves are a life blood of the reef as they create a safe habitat for small fish to mature before venturing out to the open sea. In this new installment of our Off the Beaten Path track we jump in, with our camera, to find an open channel on our own and without a guide. What we find is stunning: Upside down jellyfish; oysters; colorful sponges, and many small fish you typically see, in larger form, out on the reef. Filming this area is a challenge with currents and silted out water. It can be a cinematographer's nightmare which is why most video of mangroves is above the water. We give you a view from below. Please enjoy a place you might not ever think to look when visiting the island.

278,Drysuit Diving - BC Lift Capacity,scubadiving,"I recently started drysuit diving and am trying to work out whether my BC has enough lift or if I should upgrade.

My BC has a 34lb lift capacity and I dive with 35lbs lead. I use a steel 100, which is -8.5lbs buoyant when full. This means that if I put all of my lead in my BC, the rig by itself is about -10lbs full and -2.5lbs empty.

It's not good to have the rig by itself be negatively buoyant when inflated, since if you have to take it off it'll sink. So I guess one option might be to move 10lbs to a weight belt.

What would you do? Move some weight to a belt or get a BC with 45+ lbs lift? Any other ideas/options?"

I'm not seeing any community rules in the margins so sorry in advance if I'm breaking anything. Also let me preface this by saying I'm not seeking any medical device. As might be obvious, I know nothing about scuba diving, have never gone, and likely won't any time soon.

I'm just wondering how scuba helmets work. Do scuba helmets require a mouthpiece for a diver to consciously keep in his/her mouth? If not, why couldn't somebody just take a nap or have a slumber party underwater (assuming unlimited supply of whatever gases are in those containers on your back)? Are there different designs with some requiring conscious effort and others not? What about those scary-looking deep diving helmets that look like they're out of some old horror movie? That stuff would scare a shark away. It looks like it'd be really hard to fit a mouthpiece into those things.

Thanks for any lessons!"

Ian runs a dive shop in our town, and it seems fine at first glance but I've had friends and colleagues (I'm a free dive instructor) tell me what happens in his courses. He always offers boat dives at the best dive sites, but then the boat is conveniently not working on the weekend so he takes them to a boring site closer to town and then teaches the rest of the course there in 5m of water on sand.  
My boss has said he's incompetent and has seen him ignoring struggling students which my boss then had to rescue. From talking with him myself multiple times he is an extremely negative, racist and cynical.

I'm obviously not an expert in the area, just have an interest due to family history. I could really use some book recommendations, articles, or maybe documentaries too? Anything that would help me educate myself to write about it would be great.

As a side job, she also works as a scuba diving instructor (it's part of the services offered by the marine biology center), and ideally, that's when she discovers there's something disturbing the local wildlife, and it connects to the pollution scandal plot.

Do you get assigned a diving buddy when you go out with a dive club? I wouldn’t have anybody joining with me so I’d have to be partnered with someone new. 

I’m also a little nervous since I would be younger than a lot of the other divers (most of the divers I see where I live are middle-aged men, and I don’t see a lot of younger women like me in the scene). 

I’m also not super experienced like a lot of other divers, so I don’t want to make anyone feel as if I’m holding them back on a dive. Even so, I really like the activity and I would try my best to be a good dive buddy and follow safe practices. Any insight would be appreciated!"

I recently developed some neurological symptoms of decompression sickness after a dive :(. Specifically, my entire left side of my body felt slightly numb/had less feeling than my right side. The best way I could describe it was feeling like I had a layer of clothing over the left side vs. right side. Before going through the hyperbaric chamber, I also felt some tingling in my toes/fingers and some pain in my joints.

 I went through two sessions (Table 6 and Table 5) of the hyperbaric chamber (unfortunately not until about 18 hours after the dive then 30 hours after the dive), and was cleared by the diving doctor to leave the hospital and fly home 72 hours later.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still experiencing some numbness on my left side, and just wondering if anyone has had the same experience and if I should still be taking it easy on any sort of physical exertion, and if so, for how long?

My worry is my fibromyalgia will be a barrier to getting certified. 

I’ve read several forums on diving sites that mention it’s doable but they definitely need help at times when it comes to lifting gear and climbing the ladder. 

I really don’t want my disability to get in the way of me doing this because I’ve put it off for far too long. 

Anyone have fibromyalgia and dive? Or has anyone experienced diving with someone who has fibro? 

I guess I’m looking for some reassurance that it’s totally doable and I can get certified. 

Thank you."

402,Would sessions in a hyperbaric chamber help prepare my ears to equalize better when diving?,scubadiving,"I got certified 2 summers ago while on vacation, and during my first dive in the ocean it took me a while to get my ears to equalize (and even then I felt a lot of pressure and some mild pain through the remainder of the dive). I did all the things suggested: took my time descending, ascended a bit and then tried again, tried multiple techniques to equalize pressure, etc. On my second dive the next day, they adjusted a bit quicker, with less pressure and pain than the day before but still some discomfort. On my third dive, it was much easier, like my body was finally adjusting to the new situation. 

I haven’t gone diving since that vacation thanks to covid, but I have a diving trip coming up in a week. I have access to a hyperbaric chamber at a physical therapy place I visit, and I was wondering if doing some sessions in that might prep my ears so it doesn’t take me 3 dives to have my ears feel good underwater. The hyperbaric chamber pressurizes and you have to pop your ears just like you would when flying or diving. Has anyone ever done this? Or is there something helpful you’d suggest to help a new diver equalize their ears faster? Thanks!"

After that we started heading downstream more and this is when I started having problems equalizing but I slowly was getting used to how to do it kindve.

At time of purchase these trips were discounted;

RSA III Published $2599 pp less $800 = $1799 Aggressor Price x 2 = $3598

Nile Queen Published $1849 pp less $500 = $1349 Aggressor Price x 2 = $2698

Total Original Value $8896 Total Originally Paid $6296 

I have not discussed a price with my clients but I assume they will accept about any offer. I'd guess $3000 for all vouchers wold be a great deal for all parties.

I recently posted on the thread about a website that I wanted to create. Thank you all for the input; I am moving forward and creating content. The site is live, but I only have two articles on there. I am working on my writing and getting better.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently had an idea of creating a dive planning sheet. The idea is you could input your planned depth, cylinder pressure, cylinder number and size, and oxygen content. The calculator will spit out your:

&amp;#x200B;

Estimated Cylinder Duration

US Navy No D Time Limit at Planned Depth

Partial Pressure of Oxygen at Max Depth

Partial Pressure of Nitrogen at Max Depth

A Risk of Nitrogen Narcosis chart

A Chart showing PP02 for depths near the planned depth

EAD (if using nitrox)

EAD No D Limit (According to the US Navy)

The Extra Time the Nitrox mix would afford you compared to Air

ATA of the Water Column

PSI experienced at that depth

&amp;#x200B;

I wonder if this sounds like something useful and if anyone has any additional input about what features a diver would like to know in this kind of chart. Has this been done before? Is this information easy for everyone to access? 

&amp;#x200B;

A little background in case anyone is wondering. I am a US Navy Chief Petty Officer and a Navy Diver who leads a team at the NR Navy Experimental Dive Unit for the US Navy. I have been a 1st Class Navy Diver for more than 12 years and have a passion for this kind of geeky stuff. I am so use to diving and being around those who know that, unfortunately, I am no longer certain what is considered common dive knowledge and what is considered advanced.

&amp;#x200B;

Greetings r/scubadiving,

I'm a student at Hogeschool Utrecht and currently in the final stage of my study and I was wondering if you could help me with the most challenging part of my thesis: finding interview participants

For my research I need to conduct around 10 interviews with Dutch scuba divers who go diving on holidays. The purpose of this study is to gain insight regarding their motivations and preferences when choosing a dive destination, as well as the role social media plays throughout the customer journey.

Due to COVID, the interviews will most likely need to be done via video calling apps/discord (don't need to be on camera). But I'm open to doing it face-to-face too! Before the interview I will provide you with my credentials so you can see that the data I am gathering is solely for academic purposes.

If you feel like you fit my target audience and are willing to help me out, or if you have any questions, feel free to leave a comment or pm me."

524,The Death of Dave Shaw at Bushman's Hole (Boesmansgat),scubadiving,"Hi everyone. I host a podcast called Narcosis: Into The Deep. This week I covered Dave Shaw's death. I share the scripts &amp; relevant photos online (so hearing impaired persons can also enjoy) but I thought the episode was too good not to share here too. I hope you enjoy! TL;DR at the end.

...

On January 8th, 2005 Dave Shaw and Don Shirley entered Bushman's Hole - a deep submerged freshwater sinkhole in the Northern Cape province of South Africa. Reaching a depth of 886ft (270m), only one of them would return alive.

Bushman's Hole is freshwater sinkhole, meaning the water in there is nice and clear. It almost 900ft (274m) deep - about as tall as the Eiffel Tower. The top of Bushman's Hole has a narrow opening and at about 66ft (20m) down, almost like an upside down funnel, it opens up to about 400ft (122m) wide.

On December 17th, 1994, nearly a decade before Dave and Don's dive, 20 year old Deon Dreyer of Johannesburg, South Africa was conducting a practice dive with a team of technical divers at Bushman's Hole. Deon had recently been invited to join a South Africa cave diving association and he was asked to be a dive support for a planned dive reaching 492ft (150m).

On that fateful December day, Deon wouldn't return to the surface. First-hand accounts from those who dove with him, state Deon was lost during their ascent back to the surface. They theorized Deon had lost consciousness because of either oxygen toxicity or hypercapnia, a condition of abnormally elevated carbon dioxide, which can be induced by the high work-rate of breathing underwater at such an incredible depth.

Deon's dad, Theo, hired divers to attempt the retrieval of Deon's body, but during the attempt, there was no sign of his body, only his helmet. Deon's parents, left without their son's body, placed a plaque on a rock wall near the entrance to Bushman's Hole as a remembrance for their son. This death would rock the local cave diving community - because almost always a diver's body was recovered. But sadly, for Deon, this was not the case. For many years it was assumed his body would never be recovered because it was simply too deep - and the plaque was a continual reminder to cave divers that a body lay within.

Then, in October of 2004, Dave Shaw and Don Shirley were diving Bushman's Hole. Don, in an interview with NPR, states that the hole is so large and dark, even the most powerful flashlights aren't very effective. He states: ""You are in pitch black, absolute pitch black. So if you shine the light any direction, it will disappear. The darkness will eat the light. Basically, being 900 foot \[274m\] in a cave, you might as well be on the moon. In fact, I think more people have walked on the moon than have actually been those sort of depths in caves.""

And it's true - 12 people have walked on the moon compared to only 6 people total that have dove successfully past 820ft (250m). And while Dave and Don were down on their 9hr and 40min dive, Dave's light catches something - an old wetsuit filled with bones. Dave swam over to the body and tried to pull it free - he knew EXACTLY who this was. But the body was stuck in decades of mud and silt build up. Breathing heavy, and already a minute over his planned bottom time, Dave thought ""I shouldn't work this hard at this depth. It wasn't in the plan"" so they had to leave the body there.

Once back on the surface, Don and Dave called the parents of Deon Dreyer. ""We're going to retrieve your son's body"" they told them. The pair of divers saw this as an important mission and immediately started planning the recovery dive.

...

But before we discuss the recovery dive, let's first talk about the dangers of diving 900ft (274m) deep and what rebreathers are. \[\*Disclaimer: I'm only open-water recreationally certified. I cover this in one of the episodes on my podcast. But I break down everything into simple terms for non-diver listeners\]

Being that these divers are at such an incredible depth, pre-planning is extremely important. Every 33ft (10m) down you go, essentially doubles the risks you're exposed to. Too much nitrogen is like a narcotic and you can suddenly feel drunk; too much helium can make you twitch uncontrollably; if you breath to heavily, like panting while try to remove Deon's body, you'll pass out. There's also another important safety factor to consider - decompression sickness, also known as the bends. Ascending to the surface too quickly won't allow the proper time for the gases in your body to decompress. The gas bubbles can block blood flow or cause other serious, life-threatening complications.

Diving as deep as Don and Dave were planning requires a lot of technical training because these divers weren't using a normal diving system. They were using devices known as a rebreather. Again, this is very technical so I'm going to try to break down these devices as best as I can for my non-diver listeners.

When you're doing a normal, open-water recreational dive, you're using what's known as an open-circuit system. In this system, no gas is recycled. You pull air from your air tank using your regulator (aka your mouthpiece) and as you breath out, the exhaled gas is released into the waters around you. For dives using an open-circuit system, one air tank is going to last you roughly an hour - depending on your depth and how well you control your breathing.

For Dave and Don, however, they were using a closed-circuit system. Closed-circuit diving involves the use of a rebreather and other equipment that will allow some or all of your breathing gas to be recycled. When you inhale, gas will travel from your tank to your mouthpiece — just like it does with open-circuit regulators. But when you exhale, gas doesn’t go into the surrounding sea. Instead, it’s transferred back into your tank so that you can reuse it.

But a rebreather is more than just a mouthpiece; it’s an entire system used to provide and recycle breathing gas. Exhaling through the mouthpiece of a rebreather sends the gas from your lungs to a rebreather component known as a carbon dioxide scrubber. Here, the scrubber removes carbon dioxide from the gas before sending it to the counterlungs. The counterlungs are a device that assist divers with inhaling and exhaling gas by maintaining the same pressure as the diver's lungs.

If you're not a deep diver, I know what you're thinking… This is all very confusing. The main take-away form this is that a rebreather allows you to recycle your air. According to a study published in the Marine Technology Society Journal, closed-circuit divers consume 17 times less gas than open-circuit divers. With the gas being recycled, closed-circuit divers can stay underwater longer than their open-circuit counterparts. This is the critical piece that allows Dave and Don to go on these insanely deep, incredibly long dives. But even with recycling air, Dave and Don would still need to carry 6 air tanks with them. They had a very, very long dive ahead of them.

So now that you know more about rebreathers, let's talk about the dive to recover Deon's body.

...

On January 8th, 2005, at 6:15am, just over 2 months after initially locating Deon's body, Don Shirley and Dave Shaw would re-enter the waters at Bushman's Hole. During their pre-planning, Don had done everything in his power to minimize the risks. He planned to have 35 backup tanks of gas in the water—enough so that he, Dave, and even some support divers could survive total rebreather failure. He arranged for a winch system to be set up that could haul a diver on a stretcher up the cliffs of the hole to a decompression chamber that the police trucked in. To cope with any medical emergencies, Don also recruited a doctor to be on scene.

Don was confident in their pre-planning. He stressed over and over that this was an ""attempted"" body recovery. No one has ever attempted a body recovery at this depth and Don didn't want to lose any of his divers to this mission.

Dave, Don, and the other support divers gathered for their last briefing the day before the dive. Dave was the diver planned to go the deepest and recover Deon's body and he told the group of divers: ""The most important person on this dive is you. If you have a problem, deal with your problem and forget about me. It's better to have one person dead than two."" In a private conversation, Don asked Dave if he wanted him to come all the way to the bottom if he had any problems. Dave considered the question for a moment then finally said ""Yes, but only come down if I signal."" Normally in a cave dive, when you flash a light or wave it around, that's the distress signal.

With that, Don turned the group for one last message: ""If Dave doesn't make it, if I don't make it, we stay there. That's the end of the story. We don't want to be recovered.""

Don, in his interview with NPR, recounted their entry into Bushman's Hole on January 8th, 2005. They dropped their shot line, or aka their safety line, down into the depths. Dave went in first and Don followed him 14 minutes later. At 14 minutes in, Dave should have been to Deon's body and should be almost done with his recovery. At this point, he'd slowly ascend to meet Don at their rendezvous point of 725ft (221m). But at about 500ft (152m) during Don's descent, he saw Dave's light below him but it was remaining still - too still. Don was also expecting to see some of Dave's bubbles ascending past him but since he didn't see any of Dave's bubbles. He knew instantly something had gone wrong. At this point, it was more than 20 minutes into Dave's dive and he should have been ascending.

Don knew there was no room for error here. Dave hadn't signaled for help but Don knew he needed it. A motionless diver at this depth almost certainly meant a dead diver, but Don couldn't leave Dave behind without seeing if there was anything he could do.

Don descended past his planned depth and reaching 833 ft (254m), deeper than he had ever gone before, he suddenly heard a large crack.

His rebreather controller, located on his forearm, had imploded under the intense pressure that comes from diving at this depth. At this point, it wasn't that big of problem for Don. He had trained for this type of scenario and knew exactly what to do - he would need to add oxygen to his gas mixture manually. But this was a full-time occupation and Don knew he could no longer attempt to save Dave.

At this type of depth, problems can easily cascade into death. Oxygen becomes toxic after about 180ft (55m) and Don had accidentally added too much oxygen. Don knew he was in serious danger but he also knew he couldn't ascend too quickly.

Don says ""The surface is not somewhere that you can actually go to solve a problem. When you have a problem, you have to solve that problem there where you are. And if you don't solve that problem, you don't come back. … And I was thinking, OK, Dave might come back. He's either dead or he's working his way back. But all I could deal with was what was in front of me.""

Every minute spent at this depth added a full hour of decompression time on the way back up, and slowly ascending back to the surface, Don now had 10 hours ahead of him.

Due to the high oxygen levels, Don started to pass out. Then he got a helium bubble in his ear. If you didn't know this, a lot of your balance comes from your inner ear. So when Don got this helium bubble in his ear, he lost his balance completely. He had absolutely no sense of up, down, sideways or anything. And then, he lost grip of his guide line.

He kept passing out, waking up, passing out, waking up, swimming in these little circles, spinning around, trying to find his guideline. This line is the only way Don knew how to get out of the cave. At this depth, it's pitch black. You don’t see the light coming from the surface, you only see what's right in front of your flashlight.

Finally, Don's light caught a hold of the guideline. He grabbed the shot line but now he was experiencing extreme vertigo. Because of this, Don began vomiting underwater in between breaths.

He was eventually able to stabilize himself and slowly ascended back up, towards the surface, where he eventually met up with a support diver. Using a waterproof pencil and a slate made for underwater communication, Dave wrote ""I'm OK. And Dave's not coming back."" Don was hopeful that Dave would, but since they hadn't met up yet, he knew the harsh reality of the situation. And at this point, the support diver had one mission: to support Don back to the surface. All Don could do was breath; he was so exhausted from everything he had experienced he could barely even swim. After a 12 and a half hour dive, Don emerged from Bushman's Hole and had to be winched up the cliff face. Within 22 minutes he was in the decompression chamber before being taken to a hospital in Johannesburg the next morning.

Don survived but Dave wouldn't emerge from Bushman's Hole that day. Dave was dead.

Over the next two weeks, Don would have to undergo 11 total decompression chamber sessions for a total of 27 hours due to the helium bubble in his inner ear. It was more than a month before he could think clearly or walk down a crowded street. He was left with permanent damage that impaired his balance, but after a couple of months of recovery, he was able to go cave diving again.

A week after their failed mission, Dave's body was found. It had floated up and was found about 66ft (20m) under the surface caught under an underwater ceiling inside the cave. Dave's body was entangled in a line and so was a body bag - the body bag used to retrieve Deon's body. Ultimately, Dave had completed his mission: he recovered Deon's body and brought it back to the surface.

Sadly, in this event, we yet again see another diver who recorded his own death and the mystery of what happened to Dave Shaw was soon uncovered.

...

Don Shirley and Peter Herbst, one of the support divers on the mission, turned on Dave's last video. They HAD to know what happened to Dave.

The video starts and they see Dave entering the hole, they hear the shot line squeak through his fingers as he slid down. In just 11 minutes, Dave reached the bottom of the cave - more than a minute and a half faster than they had planned. As soon as he hit the bottom, he instantly began swimming over Deon's body, pulled out the body bag, and got to work.

Dave started to slip the body bag over Deon's legs and as he does this, he accidentally kicks up silt. When it clears, Deon's body is now eerily floating in front of Dave.

This was totally unexpected. Deon, as it turned out, was not completely skeletal as everyone had theorized, and he was no longer stuck in the silt. Instead of decomposing, his corpse had mummified into a soap-like composition that gave it mass and neutral buoyancy.

The fact that the body was now loose, and not pinned to the ground, was not one of the scenarios that the recovery team had thought about. The body was not meant to be floating. It's a lot easier to slip a bag over an immobile body than a body floating and rolling in front of you. In the video, they can see Dave fumbling and, for the first time, he lets out an audible grunt of effort.

Dave's increasing distress in his breathing is audible in the video and Don questions why Dave didn't leave the body at this point. Every scenario they had planned for involved getting Deon's body into a bag and since he was now floating, the body bag could float to the surface. However, Dave is responding only to the pounding of his narcosis and his determination to finish the job.

He keeps working to control the body, letting go of his light so he can use both hands. Deon is rolling and turning in front of him, resisting Dave's efforts to get him into the bag. Dave has been at it for two minutes now and his line is seemingly everywhere. It snags on his light, and Dave pauses to clear it.

Don, watching the video, threw his hands up in anger at this; a cave diver should never let gear float loose. It's a recipe for disaster, he says.

Now, Dave is acting confused. He's working at the height of his torso instead of his feet and his movements have lost purpose. After almost 4 minutes of bottom time, Dave pulls his scissors out, fumbling to open them, trying to cut away Deon's dive tanks as he slid the body into the bag - per their plan. But Dave's breathing rate continues to increase. Suddenly he loses his footing on the sloping bottom. He scrambles back to the body in a cloud of silt. The grunts of effort, hateful little bursts of sound, are painfully frequent.

Dave's narcosis was increasing and according to Peter at this point ""You focus on the one thing. You don't focus on the dive anymore. The one thing becomes everything. And I think with Dave it became the body, the body, the body.""

Dave was essentially feeling the effects of 7 or 8 martinis at this point and his judgement was clouded. His main focus wasn't about saving himself - he wouldn't, couldn't focus on that. His could only focus on what he was seeing right in front of him - Deon Dreyer's body.

Finally, Dave has recovered Deon's body. He turns to ascend up, to try to meet Don at their rendezvous point, but he gets snagged on something. Turning awkwardly, and his breathing now becoming desperate, he notices his line is snagged on Deon's dive tanks that are sitting at the bottom.

He pulls at the cat's cradle of cave line, as if trying to sort it out. Every breath is now a sharp grunt. Dave struggles to move forward again but is anchored by the weight of Deon's body. The scissors are still in his hand, trying to cut himself out of the tangled lines, but he never cuts anything. The pace of his breathing keeps accelerating, and there is a tragic, gasping quality to it, so painful to listen to that Don and Peter turn the sound off.

21 minutes into his dive, Dave begins to pass out from the high amounts of carbon dioxide in his lungs. He's dying and one minute later, there are no more movements. Dave Shaw is dead.

...

Nuno Gomez, who is the last person alive today who knows what it's like to dive to the bottom of Bushman's Hole understands why Dave had trouble reacting to a body that was suddenly floating instead of anchored. He says ""You don't think of a new plan while you are down there. It doesn't work. Your mind is clouded. You cannot do it. When he started putting the body in the bag and it didn't work, he should have immediately turned around and left."" Nuno also wonders why Dave didn't do more build-up dives to increase his tolerance for narcosis - similar to how a climber will try to acclimate to altitude. Nuno doesn't think the risk of losing a diver was worth recovering Deon's body but either way, he honors Dave. It was a noble dive that took a lot of courage.

Other divers who were there that day state that they are sorry Dave died but not sorry for him. Verna van Schaik says ""Dave was going to go back. The fact that Deon was there just made it more interesting and more exciting. Dave knew the risks. They were his risks, and he took them.""

Every diver there that day will keep diving, and instead of second-guessing Dave, they say they are proud of him. Peter Herbst says ""Dave took rebreather diving where it has never been before. People never knew about \[rebreathers\] until he died showing what can be done.""

Ten days after Bushman's Hole gave the bodies back, Theo and Marie Dreyer went to see their son. When the morgue attendant asked them to step in, Marie wasn't sure what to expect. When she saw a fully fleshed-out body, her tears stopped, and she felt happy. Lying in front of her was her son and Theo marveled that Deon's legs still held their athletic shape.

Ann Shaw, Dave Shaw's wife, would later spread Dave's ashes around South Africa - the place that he had come to know and love so much.

Lisa Shaw wrote in a eulogy for her father ""I am at peace because he died doing something he loved; very few of us will ever get that privilege.""

...

TL;DR: Dave Shaw discovered the body of a missing 20-year-old boy at almost 900ft under the surface in an underwater cave. After 2 months of planning, they would go back to attempt the retrieval but it would ultimately cost Dave's life to get Deon's body back to the surface.

I did my OW last week with my girlfriend after a year of browsing subs like /r/thalassophobia and /r/submechanophobia and being fascinated by the mysterious unexplored depths of the ocean.

I didn't realize I would enjoy diving so much and I'm already planning my next trip! I'm really interested in seeing something mysterious like a shipwreck, but the wrecks around me seem to be 20+ meters deep and I'm only allowed to go 18m.

However, I haven't saved up quite enough for an advanced course and I'd like to do some more dives before commiting to the advanced course and going deeper.

Any suggestions for someone who craves an ""adventure""? Shore diving doesn't seem as interesting for me, I am more interested in the ""mysterious unknown locations"". I'm also interesting in free diving, especially since it's not too expensive. I also like photography but I'm not ready to invest in a camera."

542,Great Blue Hole Belize,scubadiving,"I am planning a trip to Belize next month to dive the great blue hole. This will be my second vacation planned around diving after going to Honduras to get my advanced open water a year ago. 
When I went to Honduras I booked my diving in advance, just to be met upon arrival by multiple shops (including the one I'd booked with) offering better rates than I had paid. All of the locals I met laughed when I told them this and said to never book diving in advance and let the shops compete for your business. 
Does anyone have experience if diving in Belize is the same or should I try to book in advanced? I have done a bit of research would love additional dive shop recommendations if you have had a good experience."

I've been diving for about 4 years now since I moved to Florida, I'm currently about to finish my DM and will start IDC within the next month or so (I'm going through SDI/TDI) I'm curious to know your opinions though, how likely would it be to land an instructor position anywhere in Florida? I realize that this is probably gonna come back with some unfortunate responses but I'm hoping for some advice to direct me into the right path. Personally, I've always loved every aspect of diving since I started and this has been my goal for a while but it wasn't until now that I could realistically finance it.

Anyways, I'd appreciate any advice and/or recommendations to continue on my path forward. Thank you greatly in advance!!

I would first like to extend my gratitude to this community - I posted last year about being nervous for my open water and you guys gave some solid advice. Unfortunately, that didn't happened because of COVID-19, and I am instead only now doing my Open Water with SSI. 

I would like to ask for some advice, mostly psychologically. I did my pool session on yesterday, and cleared all my drills on the first try. However, I realised that I was feeling kind of nervous, anxious and in a slight state of ""what the f am I doing here, how am I breathing here, why can't I use my nose"" and that made me at certain parts want to ascend back to the surface. However, I just kept deep breathing and focusing on and pulled through. 

Now here is my worry - I am diving on Saturday, which will be focused on performing drills around 5-7m under water and the visibility (Singapore) is very bad. Its on average, 3-4m of vision. I have a history of claustrophobia. I am going with a group of 5 friends and girlfriend, and she too is nervous about Saturday as she struggled with mask clearing. I would be extremely grateful, extremely extremely grateful, if  you can share with me some tips  and personal experiences. Much love everyone :)"

**Narcosis: Into The Deep** is a brand new type of podcast! It's an investigative podcast all about SCUBA diving and marine accidents and deaths.

Each week a different scuba diving or marine accident will be presented along with facts or theories leading up to the event as well as information on how you can prevent this happening to you while diving or out on the open waters.

The very first episode, released March 1st, 2021, covers The Blue Hole, named ""The Deadliest Diving Location in the World"". We cover the most infamous Blue Hole death, along with theories of what caused it, and what exactly makes this diving location so deadly. We also highlight a single man who has undertaken over 100 missions to recover the bodies of those who have lost their lives in this location. Listen until the end to find out what you can do to prevent becoming the next victim of The Blue Hole!

Visuals for each podcast will be posted on our [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/narcosispod/)

584,Having trouble with the mask removal skill (beginner diver),scubadiving,"Sorry for bad English, not my native language.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying for the first time to get my PADI Open Water Diver certificate. Today I had those classes in the swimming pool. I found the exercises harder harder than I'd thought, but everything went fine and I could complete all the exercises in the first or second try, EXCEPT for the last one, in which I had to take off my mask under water, breathe without the mask, put it back on, and clear the water out of it.

&amp;#x200B;

It wasn't easy for me to breathe without the mask using only my mouth, without letting water go up my nose. Actually, and funnily, I can do it quite easily when I'm floating on the surface with my face down into the water, but, when I have to do it while kneeling on the bottom of the pool, I can only do it for like 10 seconds without getting water up my nose and kind of drowning. It's especially hard for me when I have to clear the water out of the mask, that's when it's most likely for me to get water up my nose and become desperate with the feeling that I'm drowning.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried this exercise several times, like ten times, and the instructor was getting kind of impatient (even though he tried not to show it) and I was getting more and more anxious and even kind of sad for not being able to complete the exercise. In the end, I almost made it and the instructor pretended that I had made it, even though I almost drowned.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm a bit worried, especially about the scenario in which I lose my mask under water. Is it common to have so much trouble doing this exercise? Do you guys have any advice? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!"

I’ve had it since I was a kid but I’ve gone through periods where I suffer and periods where I prosper. I do have attacks every couple years but I’m able to workout regularly, surf, skate, free dive, snorkel, spearfish. I literally spend all summer underwater spear fishing. 


Idid a scuba course back in December-didn’t disclose my asthma because I thought I would be fine. I aced the exam and day one but come day two I was still able to do mask clears and whatnot but I kept struggling to get a breathe out of the reg(maybe rental gear just sucks or I suck) And kept clearing my mucus through the reg. I ended up rocketing to the surface at 11 feet deep in the pool and I took a break from the cert-he said I was welcome to come back when ready. 

Is it possible I’ll just never be able to dive or can I purchase a higher quality regulator? I’m truly bummed but I’m also coming to terms with the fact that I may just not have the lungs for scuba."

The device tracks breathing rate by measuring the change in circumference in the upper chest, abdominal regions, and from the diaphragm. The device can be integrated into a wetsuit or placed outside of the wetsuit for comfort purposes.  This device with the battery pack is approximately the size of a small wallet. Do you think that is to big/small invasive/not comfortable? Furthermore, coupled with a diving watch real time data would show whether you have an optimal breathing technique and the goal is to better enable novice divers to control their breathing. If you could state what proficiency of a diver you are and if you think you could utilize the project. Also from a design standpoint recommendations on where to place other components of the device like the battery would be helpful.  I was thinking of a clip-on to be placed on the back of the diver somewhat close to the oxygen tank. Another design aspect is what other types of additions would you as a consumer like to see in the watch, i.e. temp., depth, location, amount of oxygen, etc. 

Thank you for your time, and all comments and considerations are greatly appreciated.

As you can see from the title and due to the pandemic, I've not been diving and I'm sure I'm not the only one. But to keep myself busy I've been creating some diving related Tees, which I hope will put a slime on the face of the wear and their dive buddies. 

I would fantastic to get some feed back on design, Text Graphics etc. From a distance the dive flag design reads I hate scuba diving, but up close it reads I hate it want I can't go scuba diving .

677,Recommendation for a Compact Underwater Camera rig,scubadiving,"I’m trying to looking for an underwater camera rig that satisfy the requirements below. 

1) 1 camera to shoot on land producing better results than iPhone and underwater during travel.

2) Compact/light weight, not too bulky and good for travel since I only scuba dive when I travel oversea or out of states.

3) Very good at super macro and macro and good for video underwater.

4) Ability to not have to switch port and lenses as much as possible to shoot macro, normal (not possible with wide?) angle and video on the same dive

5) Room to grow as I get better at underwater photography. 


I have been reading a lot of articles and review videos but still have a really hard time to decide on what camera model and housing. The TG-6 was a really good choice that could satisfied most of the requirement about but it doesn’t have manual mode so it won’t meet 1 and 5. 

I really like the Sony RX100 Vii but doesn’t meet 4 and may be 2 since the full rig with light strobes looks pretty bulky. 

The Lumix 10 is also a good choice but I read review online said the lens can get dirt in after some use, it is also not very good at macro from review. 

The Olympus EPL9/10 also seems like a good candidate but it is slightly bigger than compact camera and can’t shoot macro and wide on the same dive, also require more lenses and ports, and it has lower MP.

Any suggestion for a good camera and rig setup that could meet all the requirements above or at least close enough? I really hate having to set up the gear between dives. The goal is to travel with these gears, take good underwater macro and super macro photos and on the same dive occasionally capture some fish portraits, large creatures (manta, sting ray, turtle…) and take videos. Also take good photos on lands. I don’t mind paying more to meet all these requirements but prefer to not overspend on compact rig at the price of a DSL full frame rig :D 

Thank you"

683,Different dive light demand for u/w photography and videography?,scubadiving,"There are many high output dive lights with multiple lighting modes for color compensation coming into the market, which are claimed to be designed for u/w photography and video. But could the same one dive light make good performance in both u/w photography and video? 

One of our diving friends said he got good u/w photos, while he thought the lighting was just too white for u/w video with that same dive light. What he talked about might be the dive light’s color temperature. For example, cool white (6000K), warm white (4500K), the warmer mode could produce more pleasant lighting, creating an overall better look for u/w video. But how about the most suitable light color temperature for u/w photography, is same with u/w video?

Besides, from the light beam angle requirements, you know focusing light with narrow beam will be great for spotting out things and make nice Macro lighting in u/w photography. On the other hand, spreading the output to a wide 80 degree, 100 degree, or even a 120 degree angle, is much better for lighting up videos, so that you can cover the entire frame widely. It seems the dive light should be engineered with adjustable light beam angle to meet different needs. 

And from the dive light’s other features, such as lumens, CRI , beam quality... What do you think of the different lighting demands for u/w photography and video? 

Your sharing is much appreciated!"

720,Does the dive light with high CRI be less efficient?,scubadiving,"Comparing with lumens, intensity, color temp, tint, CRI is the more subtle factor that affects the output of a dive light LED. The difference between high and low CRI might be virtually unnoticeable, unless comparing beams of the low and high CRI light next to each other. So how does the CRI affect the dive lights’ output? Some people think a light with high CRI LED comes at the price of efficiency. 

Theoretically speaking, standard cool-white LED has the thinnest phosphor layer and convert the blue light mostly to green and yellow, which are the wavelengths that the human eye are most sensitive to. Thus you get high lumens per watt. 

High CRI LED needs more broad spectrum, i.e. more orange, and especially more red. And human eyes are not very sensitive to red, which will cause more mismatch between spectrum and human eyes sensitive curve. So you get lower lumens per watt even if you have the same watts of light outputted after conversion in the phosphor. 

Besides, the deep blue and deep red phosphor used in high CRI LED is less efficient, and more energy is converted into heat. And the phosphor layer is usually thicker which further reduces efficiency. 

While, there are also people believe that any loss in efficiency between high CRI and standard cool white is more theoretical than practical. You really won't notice any dramatic differences between the two in normal use.

So I’m on a liveaboard and it’s the last day. I always skip the last dive to avoiding the feeding frenzy that is kit cleaning so I’m done before everyone else has started. This is important to me and blood pressure in general. I think this is a sensible process. 

However today I had a conflict. I was having phone sex with my girlfriend who lives far far away. I had and orgasm and so did she but she ha s the capacity to keep on going. She wanted more and had certain devices vibrating in various orifices when I realised the divers would be back soon and I hadn’t washed/packed my kit so I bailed and left her and her devices to it. It was unfortunate but necessary. 

As it turns out my timing was perfect - I sorted all my gear and 90% packed just as the hordes of other divers got back on the boat.  

My girlfriend is a new scuba diver so I don’t think she understands I hung on as long as I could before bailing. She’s thinks I’m a bastard but I think I was being practical. And we both had one orgasm each which I thought meant we were level.

759,Can You Still Be a Diver If You Have Syncope?,scubadiving,"Hi, I just wanted some opinions from experienced scuba divers.

My boyfriend's dream job is to become a marine biologist, but recently he was diagnosed with syncope. His results are being examined to identify exactly what kind. Basically at random points for a few seconds at a time he'll ""faint"" (best way I can describe it). Right after it happens, he's just fine and usually he remains in enough control to stop from falling over.

He's been told to drink more water, eat more salt and drink stuff with electrolytes. Maybe it's just wishful thinking but I think drinking more water is legitimately helping. However, I know that diving under normal circumstances comes with risks, let alone a condition like this. I've read forums about the subject but found conflicting information. One said that the risk is small underwater since the effect of gravity is lessened, others say it's a complete no go.

This has been his dream since he was a little kid, and I hope he doesn't have to give it up. One reason he never went to his doctor about it is because he was worried that's what he'd be told (teenage boy logic, ik). On the other hand, I obviously want him to be safe.

Thank you for the help."

I haven't been able to travel home to the UK since the pandemic and of the 3 Airlines that flew here, only 1 remains. 

Im planning on flying to South Africa for my boyfriends dads triple bypass surgery and staying there awhile, but as I work for like $3 a day, a $400 flight is a huge amount of money to spend and I'm basically worried about the airline going bust or not being able to fly due to covid restrictions. Is there any way I can insure myself against either of these?

I imagine this would've been travel insurance but as I'm not in my home country (the UK), I can't extend my old dive + travel insurance. DAN would've been ideal insurance and they are the only one I know of that insures you while abroad (in the sense you don't have to be in your home country at the time of insurance).

1. Is travel insurance what I'm looking for?
2. Do you guys know of any dive insurance that will cover this (I would rather take out dive insurance over travel insurance if it was what I'm looking for)

The biggest reason I want to upgrade is the FOV on my current mask is not great in my opinion. I’m looking for something that is comfortable but also opens up the viewing window quite a bit. The current masks that I’m considering is something from the TUSA Freedom line but I’m open to any suggestions. Thanks!!

Wetsuit: looking for a 3mm since I only dive in warm water. The Henderson Aqualock looks really nice so I'm wondering if anyone has used this wetsuit or something similar. Current wetsuit is a Mares women's size 3.

BCD: I'm super interested in the Hollis LTS but nervous about ordering it because they don't carry an XS, which is what I always wear in BCDs. Does anyone have experience with Hollis sizing? Or have any recommendations on something similar? I definitely want back inflation with an integrated weight system.

892,Finally ready to purchase scuba gear but...,scubadiving,"Hi, I am finally in a place where I am ready to purchase my own scuba gear (bcd, reg, octo, pressure gauge, etc everything essential but a tank), but I’m hesitant and unsure about brands and quality. The dive shop I went to recommended Sherwood Ladies Luna, which I tried on in the shop and felt comfortable in. For a regulator he recommended Sherwood Oasis, and for the gauge he recommended metal which is slightly more expensive than plastic but is supposed to be better quality. He did not mention brands for the octo so I’m assuming that does not matter as much? Unsure.

Does anyone have any input for this situation/experience with Sherwood gear or any recommendations if what I’m considering is not worth it?

I would like to say while I myself have never actually dived before so I do not know the terms and information taught during training of any sort, and this is also assuming this is a true thing that happens of course, I'd like to think something like this is fake but the world is a strange place, the ocean especially."

Due to COVID closing my gym, I have recently taken up lap swimming at a pool which is able to socially distance people.

We are only allowed to swim for 45 minutes, so I have been swimming front crawl intervals of 7 minutes with a 3 minute rest for 40 minutes total.  I'm doing this for a few weeks to get my sea legs back, but I'd eventually like to start doing workouts that would improve my SCUBA proficiency.

Does anyone have any recommendations for pool workouts that will make me a better SCUBA diver?  I have about 30 dives under my belt, so I am not very experienced.

958,PADI Open Water - pool practice on my own ahead of time,scubadiving,"Hello,

I am in the process of getting my PADI Open Water Diving Certification in SoCal. I had the first pool session on 7/18, but nothing since then.

I am scheduled to have my first open water dive off a boat this coming Sunday 8/9.

As of today I have all the gear for this coming open water dive (wetsuit / bcd / tank / regulator / weights / gloves / finns / mask / snorkel / boots).

I will have access to a pool by the end of the week, and was planning to use that opportunity to refresh my memory / re-practice mask clearing / proper trim etc under water, but found out that since I'm yet to be certified, I can't use the tank under water unsupervised...

So - without using the tank - **how would you suggest I use that private pool time to best get back up to speed?**

Alternatively, any suggestions re: ""extending"" my snorkel so I could still breathe while remaining underwater for a while?"

Any ideas on how to defog one without damaging coating/glass temper? The suggestion box is wide open.

I had an unfortunate experience to have two heart attacks in the past 3 years. I’m actually healthy meaning I am not overweight nor do I suffer from high cholesterol or high blood pressure it’s just build a protein that causes me to build plaque at a faster rate. Now that I have my situation under control with 4 stents and medications(blood thinners, cholesterol, etc) I always had the passion to get my dive certification with my son who is 14 years old. But I went for a routine appointment to my cardiologist and posed him the question and he said in all his years of practice he was never asked if it is safe for a person with my condition to safely dive. So he told me he would get back to me with an answer from some of his older colleagues. I couldn’t wait so that’s why if there is anyone in this subreddit that can answer this question that would be great. I’m athletic and it is something I really want to do with my son as a bonding experience. Thanks for any advice."

I'm AOWD + EAN certified diver (40 logged dives) 

So I'm mostly looking for good value overall. I'm quite certain I want a wing style bcd with backplate as I like the fit, as well as the back support. I'll list the prices for items I received a quote for. Prices are in Canadian. 

For bcds 

I've tried the OMS smartstream (27 lb) as well as the aluminum comfort harness 3 (roughly $920) 

 I really enjoy the fit on the smartstream. I also tried the IST dolphin wing (30lb) roughly $620 Canadian) which was recommended by a dive instructor, but I haven't many reviews and am not too familiar with the brand. 

SEAC modular one - the original wing bcd I was looking at because of its lower price compared to the others but the reviews seemed to reflect that (decent performance for a decent price $458.99)

Regulators 

I was recommended the Evo 250/s600 regulator + r195 by a dive shop but after shopping around (and speaking to different dive professionals) I heard conflicting statements about them. 

The dive shop that recommended them said that he had customers who used previous generations that lasted 25 years and recommended servicing once a year (or every 100 dives) 

A second shop I went to recommended a servicing once every 3 - 4 years. 

A dive instructor I spoke to said:  

""I have been diving for more than 30 years and for the first 10 years I used Scuba Pro gear exclusively. I found the regulators to be a pain, they would always need servicing or adjusting.  I stopped using them and switched to APEKs and Aqualung for my personal regs and for the regs I bought for my students.""

Atomic b2 + z2 octopus  were recommended by a dive guide. 


The Aqua lung Titan  and Aqualung Calypso were recommended as a good mid-range pick for recreational diving above 40m. (Waiting on quote). 

Dive computer 

Was looking at the ATMOS mission one as it seems highly recommended as a good value dive computer by most dive shops here and is readily available in Taiwan (roughly $575.31)

Anyways, I'm getting chemical pleurodesis to prevent collapses from happening again.

I got the opportunity to volunteer for marine conservation in either Barcelona spain, or Lisbon Portugal, something im very grateful for. 

I now have to decided when to go next year, the earliest times being January for Barcelona or March for Portugal. I would like to go as early as possible so I was leaning toward Barcelona, however after some research I learned that January and March are bad times for scuba diving in that area. 

It feels silly to be stressing over when I'm going, I'm lucky to get a chance to do it at all, but I really don't want to go and be freezing in the water. I've snorkeled before and as a thin guy, I get really cold when the water is cold, despite it being incredibly thrilling. So should I just relax and go for it in January or March, or is it a really good idea to wait later in the year? I'm not experienced and have only snorkeled.

tldr: I have the chance to scuba january or march 2021, but i don't want to be too cold so I'm wondering if i should wait later or not worry about it.

any feedback is greatly appreciated! I've got to decided soon"

I did a refreshment- and update-course last year and we did use rented Halcyon-Wing and Backplate-System, together with soft-lead and it was the most relaxing (and air-conserving) diving I've ever experienced.

I swore to myself, I'd only want to dive with this system in the future, especially after we could only use these basic Dive-Jackets at our last vacation.

But the pricing is insane (and pretty much unnecessary imo).

Even used systems are still too much for me.

So I tried to find some place where I can rent the equipment, but all bases and spots in my town and up to 100km far away have only the regular dive-gear.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I've seen on Amazon and mostly ebay some seemingly cheap chinese knock-offs

that aren't 400 - 700 just for the Wing and Straps and Backplate.

It was very well covered up and no one (besides her close family) knew who was responsible. We found the dive shop responsible and that it is registered with ADIP. Because of the liability release form signed, the incident will not have legal follow up. But I want some kind of justice for her. 

I know cause of experience in this corrupt country that it wasnt reported in any way. My parents are totally against it because in Guatemala you never know who are you messing with and could end up in murder. 

She was a young doctor, helping people with low resources. I want her to get some justice. Is it worth it reporting it to ADIP? will they do something?"

1272,TIFU - has anyone else has had anything this bad happen?,scubadiving,"I’m a beginning diver. I got my open water certification in January and had my first ocean water dive in the Gili Islands yesterday afternoon. I loved it so much I decided to enroll in the advanced diver certification course and I was making plans to stay in Gili T for 6-8 weeks and do my divemaster training. 

Today I did 3 dives. A deep dive in the morning (30 m) a 2nd dive in the afternoon and a 3rd dive at night. 

During the 3rd dive at night I found myself sinking too much so I pumped my BCD slightly to gain a little buoyancy. I realized I was rising too fast so I went to release some air...and I started rising faster. I freaked out a little so I kept pressing my release and I rose even faster. I felt my divemaster grab onto me and my weight belt even fell off somehow. 

I surfaced like a balloon and my divemaster followed after shortly. That’s when I realized I had been pressing my inflate button when I was sure I was pressing my air release button. 

I ascended rapidly from 18 meters after a total of a 10 minute dive. I feel fine physically, but I feel like complete moron mentally. I don’t know if I was narc’d or what...none of it made any sense. It was my 4th dive in 28 hours so maybe I just pushed myself too far. 

My divemaster has been very kind and told me not to worry about it, but I can’t help but feel like garbage. I love diving...I had ambitions to become an instructor or Tech diver and now I feel mentally destroyed. 

tldr: I ascended rapidly from depth because I confused my inflate with deflate button on my BCD. Wondering how much of an idiot I am and hoping to hear other TIFU diving stories so I can gain some level of diving confidence again"

I understand that will mean an open heel with wet suit boots for warm water but I don't mind that at all.

Any recommendations on best dive spots  that are also beginner friendly? I might also be interested in a night  dive while I'm there, so any recommendations are welcome for that too.

Or other comparable dive spot off Taveuni that are more beginner friendly? Again, I will be there in March, if that  changes things re: currents.

Also, if you recommend a specific area and also have a reputable dive  shop that you recommend I go to for that area, please let me know!

1329,Is there any way to fix my ears?,scubadiving,"When I was about 10 years old... I had a scuba diving accident. 
We were told not to dive if we had any sort of cold, congestion or stuffy nose. 
I was definitely congested. I told my dad AND the diving instructor that I wasn’t sure if I should go down... my nose was really stuffy. And as a very young child I had already had RSV and been susceptible to ear infections. 
But Everyone reassured me that everything was probably fine. 
It wasn’t, because around 10 feet down I heard the snap. I swallowed and it felt like there was fluid DEEP in my ear canal. 
To this day (over 6 years later) every time I swallow (eating, drinking, or just swallowing saliva before I speak) I hear/feel what I like to call “soap suds” ... it sounds like a little crackly bubbling sound deep in my ears. I sometimes get ear infections and that is the only time the crackling soap sud sound stops.... imagine every time you swallow, you hear crackling inside your head.....
it’s never been properly examined by an expert because we can’t afford that. But my regular doctor says it’s too far inside my ear to see what’s really going on. 
I’ve been told to just get used to it. 

Has anyone ever experienced this...? Is there a way to fix it?? Is it something that will get worse over time if I don’t do something??
When I was young, all I wanted to do was scuba dive. Now I can’t, and not only do I have to give up my passion, but it’s caused me great discomfort and inconvenience in my regular life."

When you talk to most rescue divers, they will tell you that this course was the most enjoyable and challenging course they have taken. In the PADI Rescue Diver Course, you learn the skills of self-rescue, diver rescue, emergency situation management, as well as accident prevention. It’s really not just enough to be able to solve problems, but we want you to know how to prevent problems from happening. The knowledge and skills you take away from this course will make you a strong asset in any dive situation, as well as giving you the confidence to help others, if ever needed.

The class is actually two parts and two different classes combined. The reason for this is because the [PADI Diver Class](http://dfwscubashop.com/elearning-classes/) has as one of its perquisites training as an Emergency First Responder. The EFR class trains future Rescue Divers in CPR, AED and first aid skills. These are vital skills that can be used anywhere, not just scuba diving. The rescue diver course itself is divided into three subparts; Knowledge Development, Skill Development and finally, Scenario Practice. The Scenario Practice puts all the training together and allows you to use your knowledge and skills in real life situations."

When I say student instructor I could be completely wrong in their title but they were trying to become instructors or something. One guy did something and the student instructor said something along the lines of, “don’t do that.” The main instructor corrected the student instructor and the guy in the water CLEARLY jokingly was like “see I didn’t f*** it up and laughed” 
The student instructor freaked out and was like don’t cuss at me I’ll f*** you up and went on this rant.

It ruined my entire day scuba was supposed to be a hobby and everyone was always so serious and pissy to the point where it seems like every scuba diver I’ve surrounded my self with treats it like a serious job and not a fun activity. Are all scuba divers just serious no fun assholes because it’s a dangerous hobby or what?"

1494,Can I get by in my class with a cheap pair of goggles?,scubadiving,"I'm going to do my dive training in a few days and I still need to buy my goggles (the ones that cover your nose). The pair at the dive shop are nearly $100 bucks (ScubaPro)! They looked and felt amazing, but since we're only diving to 20-30 feet in fresh water, and since the class is only 2 days long, I was hoping I could just get by with some cheaper ones. A pair of goggles from the local sports store only cost $20.00 and they felt only marginally inferior to the ones from the dive shop. The suction onto my face was good and seemed to be a good fit. So do you think I can get by with the cheaper pair (""US Divers"" brand) just to get me through the class?

(Of course I would love the nicer pair, but I don't go diving or swimming that much to really warrant buying them right now. Once I become a certified diver, I only see myself going out maybe 1-3 times a year realistically, and If I could, I'd rather worry about the nicer pair of goggles down the road when I'm actually getting ready to go on a real dive and not right now)"

1507,We launched diving-centric web app - we really need some early testers :),scubadiving," Hi!

We  launched a diving web app 3 weeks ago, putting it online in a very  early stage. What we’re presenting now is not even close to the the end  product, as we are developing the web app based on test results and  preferences of the first users, as we aim to build high quality and  user-friendly diving community.  
Can't do that without including real users and their opinions...

We're  adding new features weekly. At this moment we're working on tweaking  the reviews system, private messages, feed, profile improvements,  redesigning the front end, and improving the map (this is really  important one, however, right now, it has a really bad UX. Any ideas?).

**FEATURES:**

\- **Browse the map**:  dive spots/sites, businesses, divers, photos and videos, all geolocated  and pinned on the map. (filters available, so you can turn some of them  on/off) -- (Planned improvement: full screen view, more user friendly  option to move through the map)

\- **Send private messages**:  Contact other divers or businesses, create group chats, see online  status, share photos and videos privately. Book dives directly by  sending a private message to the provider.

\- **Ratings and review**s: review dive sites, businesses, dive gear

\- **Compare gear prices in different stores** (will be added after September)

\- **Second hand section** \- buy and sell used gear

\- **Tips and advice for safe and environmentally friendly dives - articles**

\- **Accommodation info** (near diving sites, to make planning your dive trips easier)

\- **Geolocate uploaded medi**a (if enabled in your profile)

\- **Upload photos and videos, make albums,** contribute photos to dive sites

\- **Detailed description of dive sites and dive conditions**

\- Anyone will be able to add a new dive spot, however, the site admin will have to approve it

\- Detailed descriptions of **dive packages and dive courses**

\- **Activity feed**

\- **Favorites/Bookmark**s: save a dive spot you like or a business you want to revisit and keep them handy in your favorites section

\- **Hangouts** (like in Couchsurfing): see nearby divers that want to hang out

Keep  in mind that most features are still under development, and some of the  published ones are probably buggy AF. I'd really appreciate if you take  10 minutes, sign up, and make some clicks or swipes on the platform.  Let me know what are those things that don't work as they are supposed  to, or if something's confusing, not clear enough.

I've uploaded some XD files of the **new web design** that will be integrated in a week or so - [check them on my Dribble profile.](https://dribbble.com/valentinametesh/projects/1441739-H2O-Globe-Diving-Centric-Web-App)

[Here's our Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/valentinametez/h2o-globe-community-web-app-made-by-divers-for-divers?ref=user_menu)  which is about to finish this Wednesday. We have already surpassed our  funding goal, but you can still support us if you'd like. :)  
Anyway,  there are 2 videos uploaded on the project page, plus you can read more  about the platform there (check the updates as well).

[Sign up, take a look around and let me know where we have problems. :)](https://www.h2oglobe.com/)

I am going scubadiving in red sea soon and I was wondering if getting a good 30m water resistant silicon case is a good idea for my phone.

I am using a Xiaomi 9T. It has got a headphone jack and a popup selfie camera so I guess it seals no air inside and it can go in and out from within its casing.

I have all the safety measures.  Spair air, full suit (some protection from jelly fish)  shark knife, all that kindof stuff.  And I have enough sense not to go cave diving, I'd do open water stuff.  

I do feel safer with a buddy watching my back, but I can't always find someone to go with.  I've almost logged enough hours I guess to help get a solo dive liscense I'm not to sure how that works.  I was told 150 hours and a course.  I've gotten my last two certifications at my school and it was a breeze going ti class every day then just going where the instructor said to take the test and get certified."

So it happened. I got in the water. Tank first. In the first dive, I started panicking as soon as I got in. Using the regulator I was able to breathe fine over surface for demo sake, but as soon as I got it water. I would gasp for water and water would get in my mouth. Kept trying and couldn't figure out breathing from nose or mouth. Gave a few try.
Second dive, I told the instructor I wanted to give it one more time. I was able to manage the regulator and breathing well but I was nervous all along going into water. This time frame was filled with water and i couldn't clear the water without pushing regulator out if mouth or lifting the shades. To say the least, I felt horrible. Since everyone but me, was able to finish this course and alot of people were first time divers with no experience.   All knew. Swimming or can swim for bit I couldn't that's how I feel solace at the moment. But hurting my self confidence a lot since all I hear is fir dive is always successful"

1763,Advice for frustrated scuba consumer (sort of...),scubadiving,"Hello,

I'm posting on here out of pure frustration hoping for some good advice. My girlfriend purchased an entire scuba set for me for Christmas (I know, she's awesome) and we're now having issues getting all the gear from the shop owner. I won't say the shop name because I'm not sure if that's necessary for me to get advice on how to best handle this situation.

&amp;#x200B;

She dealt with the shop owner completely on her own because it was a Christmas present and surprise to me. She paid with a check because the owner said he would give her a discount if she didn't pay with a credit card. He also said he would send her a receipt - which he didn't.

&amp;#x200B;

He gave her most of the gear except the computer because he said it needed to be ordered and would come in soon. I reached out to him a few days after Christmas and asked to swap out the wetsuit and BCD because they were one size to big. He agreed and said he would follow up on computer.

&amp;#x200B;

It's now been roughly 3 weeks for wetsuit and BCD and roughly 4-5 weeks for computer. We're in  communication with him via text almost daily, but he always has the best excuse for why he can't have our gear today. Every day is another excuse including missed deadlines, promises and ignoring texts.

&amp;#x200B;

This gear was not cheap (I now know what she paid) and I'm becoming concerned he's giving us the runaround and not exactly sure where to go from here. I just want what was paid for. Some options include:

\- Writing a Yelp review - His company is active on Yelp.

\- Contacting a lawyer

\- ...?

We are both very fond of nature and respect the environment were exploring, picking up man made objects throughout our dives. This is our dive aim, to protect what we love.

1951,8 TYPES OF DIVING EVERY DIVER SHOULD KNOW ABOUT,scubadiving,
1952,8 TYPES OF DIVING EVERY DIVER SHOULD KNOW ABOUT,scubadiving,"So you’ve done it! You’ve passed your Open Water Certification and you’re ready to dive into the underwater world head first to discover all the wonders it has to offer!

As a new diver, the more time you spend with other groups of more seasoned divers, the more you’ll hear about their underwater anecdotes and experiences. Wreck diving, ice diving, drift diving….. Perhaps you’re still learning some of the lingo, so you’re not sure exactly WHAT they’ve been up to, or more important WHY they’ve been doing it!

How many types of scuba diving are there? Here’s our guide to 8 TYPES OF DIVING EVERY DIVER SHOULD KNOW ABOUT, to help you decide what your next adventure should be!

1) DEEP DIVING
Number one on our types of diving list is deep diving. As an Open Water diver, your max. depth should never exceed 18 or 21m (depending on the scuba agency). A deep dive is considered everything below 18 or 21m. Why? Because an emergency ascent should be no faster than 18m per minute, and a one minute is ascent to the surface without a regulator is classed as achievable for all divers.

How deep can recreational divers go? The depth limit for divers specified by Recreational Scuba Training Council Association is 40m. But recommendations can vary from country to country. Because all recreational diving is No Deco diving, 40m is considered to be the absolute max. depth. This depth a diver is able to reach without passing the No Decompression Line (for a max of 8 min), whilst keeping the probability of Nitrogen Narcosis and Oxygen Toxicity low.

Are there any more increased risks apart from a longer emergency ascent to the surface? The deeper divers go, the more at risk they are from decompression sickness. Just because a diver sticks to the No Deco limits doesn’t mean they are immune to it. The deeper you go, the greater the risks. You are also susceptible to Nitrogen Narcosis after depths of 30m, symptoms of which include

* wooziness
* giddiness
* euphoria
* disorientation
* loss of balance
* loss of manual dexterity
* slowing of reaction time
* fixation of ideas
* and impairment of complex reasoning.

It’s a little bit like being drunk.

So why would you want to do a deep dive if it’s considered to have more risks? Deep diving gives you the opportunity to visit new underwater areas, find new type of marine life, or discover more interesting wrecks. The additional risk and journey into the unknown also make it a very exciting and rewarding experience! And like any type of diving, with the right planning, training and the right team, it’s perfectly safe.

2) WRECK DIVING

There’s a lot of human history at the bottom of our lakes, seas and oceans. Much of it in the form of wrecks – shipwrecks, aircraft, and other artificial structures, which can give us a fascinating insight into our past.

Every wreck holds promises of discovering something no-one else has seen before or unlocking an important secret to our past. It also offers us the chance to get closer to exciting or tragic maritime heritage or history. They also sometimes contain artifacts – but don’t get thrifty! They should be left it in situ so as to not compromise the archaeology and give other divers the opportunity to enjoy the wreck. In most countries, treasure hunting or removing souvenirs is an illegal act punishable by large fines or jail sentences.

Are wrecks good or bad for the environment? There are nearly three million wrecks on the ocean floor. Many of them serve as an artificial reef, creating a man-made habitat and offering protection for many types of marine life. It may take several years for a wreck-reef to mature, but when they do they expand the food web and attract all forms of life. Wrecks which are sunk accidentally can contain toxic substances and pose threats to the environment.

Can I go inside the wreck? Wrecks can represent an extreme form of diving and present new challenges for scuba divers. They gather layers of silt waiting to be kicked up by divers, and reducing your visibility to zero in a matter of seconds. They can be disorientating and are often covered in fishing lines or other debris which could pose risks of ensnarement. As a general rule of thumb, as with all scuba diving – always dive within your training, your current practice levels, and your own personal limits.

3) DRIFT DIVING

What is a drift dive? All dives which start and finish at a different point are technically drift dives. Most of the time the divers are transported by a current which can be caused by the tide, an ocean current, or if you’re in a river, it’s natural course.

Why drift dive? The choice about whether to drift dive depends on the purpose of your dive. Perhaps you are you trying to cover a large underwater area, trying not to repeat the same path twice, or trying to keep up with the marine life. At some dive spots there is almost always a current which means you have no choice but to go with the flow! The current gives the diver the wonderful sensation of flying. It allows you to cover long distances and see more habitats and formations than normal. But it can be more difficult to interact with smaller creatures on a drift dive, so the style is more suited to ‘big fish’ and ‘landscape’ dives.

Is drift diving dangerous? Like any dive, with a great plan and a great team, it is not dangerous. But there are some additional considerations you need to take into account before you get into the water. The biggest concern when drift diving is keeping the team together – it is easy for distracted divers get separated from their buddies. A ‘negative entry’ may be the best way to start your dive if there is a strong surface current.

4) ICE DIVING

Ice diving is a type of penetration diving which takes place underneath the frozen surface of a lake or sea. Typically, an ice diving team will only have one single entry and exit point, and no other access to the surface. Ice diving requires special equipment and training. Most recreational ice diving takes place in lakes making the environment more controllable. In addition, it is also easier to equip the entry and exit point.

Why would anyone want to dive underneath the ice? Ice diving provides the diver with a unique experience. The colour of the water is different, the way the light disperses in the water is different, as is the feeling of diving in an enclosed space. What marine life you can see will depend on your location, but you can be sure that it’ll be something very different from anything you’ve seen as a recreational diver in the tropics!

The most obvious hazards of ice diving are getting lost under the ice, hypothermia, and equipment failure due to freezing.

5) CAVERN DIVING &amp; CAVE DIVING

What is the difference between cavern diving and cave diving? These two types of diving sound very similar but are quite different. When you’re cavern diving, you can expect to continue to see natural light for the duration of your dive. During a cave dive, you may penetrate the cave system completely. A cave dive can take you hundreds of meters away from the entrance, and way past the point penetrated by natural light. Cave diving is a specialist technical dive, whereas cavern diving can be practiced by recreational divers.

But isn’t it dangerous? Cavern divers stay within the ‘cavern zone’ where natural light can be seen in order that they can swim towards the light ‘in a straight line’ and vacate the cavern easily in the event of an emergency. Cave divers do not have it so easy when it comes to exiting a cave. That is the reason why they are required to take an extra safety training to protect themselves and their dive buddies while they are exploring a cave system.

Why should I try Cavern diving? Cavern diving gives you the opportunity to discover what marine life exists in the darkness, and how it has adapted to life there. Different types of corals, shrimps, crabs and fish all live out of the reach of natural light and have evolved strange characteristics to compensate! Swimming towards the dark, and into the unknown, makes this an extremely exciting form of scuba diving. But it is not for the faint-hearted! Cavern diving is a good way to find out if you want to commit the time and money required to qualify as a technical cave diver.

6) ENRICHED AIR NITROX (EAN) DIVING

What is it? When we dive we rely on the air in our tank. But what we all learn early on in our diving careers is that the very air that keeps us alive underwater can also pose a threat. Pure air is composed of 21% Oxygen and 79% Nitrogen and it is the Nitrogen being absorbed into our bodies that puts us at risk. So, what if we changed the mix of gas to reduce the amount of Nitrogen we absorb?

Enriched air nitrox diving is the term used when we change the blend of Oxygen and Nitrogen in our tank. Recreational EAN scuba divers use a blend that is usually a mixture of between 21- 40% oxygen. Breathing an EAN mix gives divers the opportunity to endure a longer bottom time and allow an easier exploration of deep wrecks or other underwater features. It is also useful for divers who are making many dives over a short period to keep their residual nitrogen saturation low. It also means we feel less tired after a many days diving.

7) ALTITUDE DIVING

Not all dives spots are at sea level – a mountain lake makes an exciting challenge for divers! Altitude diving is classed as any dive spot higher than 300 metres (980 ft) above sea level. Unsurprisingly, it changes many things about the way we approach our dive.

So what’s the difference between altitude diving and diving at sea level? When we do an altitude dive the reduced atmospheric pressure at the surface of the body of water affects the diver’s depth gauges, as does the fresh water which is less dense than in the sea. When the diver ascends from depth at altitude, the rate of change as the ambient pressure drops is far greater than when ascending from a dive in the sea. These factors need to be compensated for otherwise dives considered relatively safe in the sea might be dangerous. This could generate copious nitrogen bubbles within a diver’s bodily tissues, causing an increased risk of decompression sickness.

There are many reasons people dive at high altitude, some of them maybe searching for particular objects such as WWII aircraft. For others, lakes make a great place to train when the sea is inhospitable or too distant to be practical. And of course, there are some people who are diving at altitude for scientific research purposes or only because they are attracted to mountain lakes and rivers just for the plain fun of it!

8) NIGHT DIVING

Last but not least on our Types of diving list is the night diving. When the sun disappears behind the horizon and darkness descends, a new kind of opportunity arises. Diving at night opens up a whole new world of creatures and sensations. You may be at a dive spot familiar to you during the day – but dived at night it will offer a completely different experience.

So, what will I see? As the reef transitions from daylight to darkness, nocturnal creatures that hide during the day come alive. From stealthy hunters like sharks and octopuses to ghostly glowing plankton, bizarre alien larvae and all manner of life in between. From frogfish to stargazers, ghost pipefish, blue-ringed octopuses to nudibranchs and beyond. If you’re in the right spot you might also see the natural phenomenon of bioluminescence.

You can experience an awe-inspiring light show, which is created by microorganisms, plankton and other minute critters from a chemical reaction.

Is there any special training required? due to an increased chance of disorientation, night diving requires extremely good buoyancy and spatial awareness. You will also need a new set of hand signals and some notes on how to use your torch. This is important that you can continue to communicate effectively with your buddy and not frighten any of the sea creatures with your light!

I am hoping to try scuba diving for the first time with two other first timers, this summer at Kusadasi Active Blue Diving Center. I would like to ask for general tips and things to.. Expect and be careful about, that a first timer usually doesn't see coming and should be prepared for. Also.. How will the water pressure feel? When I swim/dive (non-scuba) my head usually start hurting a lot at the 3 - 3.8m depths... Does that mean I will feel an even greater amount of pain at 6 meters with scuba diving gear on?


Other than that.. If anyone has tried diving with the place I mentioned.. Have you tried the 6m deep area? Are there plenty of fish and things to see there? Since we're first timers, we don't have a diving licence, so we are not allowed in the 8 - 15 meter depths.


Thank you very much!"

Unfortunately I have recently been seeing some negative posts about the town and there being a high Norovirus risk due to water pollution. 

We aren't high demanding gringos, my wife is from north east Brazil and we have spent a lot lot time in smaller towns that dot the region (E aí Italo/Bahia Formosa?) so we're well acquainted to latin beach town standards. But obviously, if the water is as filled with poop/beaches as polluted, the risk of Norovirus as high, and the tourists as fucking gross and annoying as some people are making it out to be, there seems to be no reason for anyone to go there regardless of how tolerant they are.

Does anybody have a sense of the truth here vs what is just Karens complaining about their bucket margarita not being filled fast enough?

2052,A couple questions about my progression,surfing,"I'm an athletic young adult male and have been a competitive swimmer most of my life, so I'm not a stranger to the water. I started surfing in August 2021, I guess this puts me at about 4-5 months, and surfing about 3-5 times per month. I started on a 7'8"" foamie and had almost no trouble popping up in white water so I quickly moved to unbroken waves. I can consistently pop up on 2-3 foot unbroken waves. 

Yesterday I went out to a beach break where the swell was 4-6 feet. During and after paddling out, I could tell I was probably in conditions above my ability, but definitely wasn't going to call it quits. I surprised even myself by being able to pop up and have a couple short rides. My main problem is that I was only able to ride straight and not take advantage of the sections of the wave. The one time I really made a conscious attempt to ride the face of the wave, I got tumbled pretty good haha. But it was awesome to be honest and I can tell I'm getting addicted.

So my question is, I'm still on my foam board. I think its probably time I move off of this thing? If I do, I really want to make an effort to ride the waves instead of just popping up and cruising straight. What kinds of things should I be looking to practice so I can accomplish this? Also, I know I want to transition to a hard board with a decent amount of volume, but do you have any recs on approximate sizing? My goal isn't to be some crazy shredder, more so just someone who can cruise on a wave and have a good time"

And also, just because some company is making money by blowing up spots, that doesn't mean all the rest of us should be mindlessly aping their behavior, particularly when the only thing gained is meaningless internet notoriety.  So think a little bit, please.  You are hereby slapped upside the head."

I recently moved to south OC and am looking to get a longboard to ride at San Onofre. I have a 7’6 currently but from what I’ve heard that appears to be way too small to use there. Would something around a 9’0 work or should I only look at a 9’6 or larger logs?

2098,Should Beginners Surf on Good Days?,surfing,"I am fairly new to surfing. Started off with a couple months in N Shore Hawaii and got pretty comfortable with it. At least I thought so before seeing the 2 months guy. Then came back to Texas and had a long break from surfing. After discovering that Surfside has a great surfing community and decent waves (and no coral) in the winter I am trying to get back to it. 

I am usually waiting on ""good days"" to get out there, since it is over an hour of drive for me. Here is my problem:

When the waves are pumping in Surfside, there is rarely any quiet time between the waves, and the current is strong. I end up trying to paddle out and getting really tired at about 70% of the way to the cleaner waters and bigger waves. When I make it, I am usually out of stamina to paddle into the wave, and if I do, I am really slow to get up and end up wiping out. 

I tried staying in the white waters, but that gets boring quick. 

Should I look for the quieter days, or are there any other ways to overcome this? 

Also, how do I work on improving my paddle game?"

2130,No other board sport allows you to create and feel as much power and grip on the surface you’re riding on as surfing does.,surfing,"Every other board has to pretty much go straight or at a bit of angle and hit the opposite side of a half pipe when they drop in on one side. Water is the only medium that allows our boards so much bite that we can drop in, smash a heavy bottom turn and create enough force to hit the same side of the pipe as to perform a maneuver. No other board can really do that, they’d slip their edge or wheels and fall. 

I think this is a huge part of why i’m so into surfing. When i used to skate and snowboard only i thought surfers were just insane cause i truly didn’t see the point. I still love snowboarding but i’ve never replayed a perfect jump or run in my head over and over the way i do with my best waves so far. I wish i had learned to skate bowl cause that seems like the only thing that might be just as interesting but im too much of a pussy these days."

I' moved this year (from SoCal to the PNW), and I noticed swells manifest themselves very differently up here. For instance, in San Diego last year, we had a swell of 5.9ft @ 15s. This produced 10-12ish foot faces in the average set. Contrastingly, in the PNW last weekend my local buoy read 8.2ft @ 15s. This produced 6-8ish foot faces across multiple different spots.

Anyway I'm pretty young so planning my first solo holiday and it's just gonna be a small (maybe a week or so) domestic trip to somewhere coastal.
 
Obviously 1 week isn't very long and I don't expect to become a pro ( or really any good) but I'd like to have a crack at surfing. Soo how exactly should I go about that? Should I rent a board or do a lesson or something? Are there even board rental shops or are they lessons included cause people could easily Nick a board. Also if I can just rent a board and go by myself is there any good inline resources to learn?
 
I'm a pretty fast learner and I skate as well so I feel I could manage or at least have fun without lessons but open to it if it's worth it. 
 
I don't have mates and I'm guessing it's a bad idea to go by myself but if I just go somewhere where others are surfing would that be fine or should I be there specifically with people (in that case I'll proabably just have to take a lesson cause loner shit).

Should I store it face up or belly up? I’m a beginner and I’m stoked I just got a new board for a deal if you saw my last post. But I’m having trouble finding a place for it to fit and have it be secure and safe. Thanks in advance

2223,Hawaiian Airlines lost my board,surfing,"Feeling bummed. I flew back home and took my board but there was a pretty bad crack on the back from the airlines so I decided to just borrow a board. Flying back to Portland, my board never comes out. I talk to the agent and they said it never left Honolulu. No ones called all day and I’ve been hold multiple times for over 30+ minutes.

Idk if I should accept it’s fate. It’s a beautiful 8’ Stewart and I’m getting bummed the more people say I can replace it. Does anyone know if the airlines will refund me for the price of the board/bag if they can’t locate it?"
2224,Surfing OBSF today,surfing,"I started surfing in august 2020 in the Bay Area when I bought an 8ft torq for $400 and a shitty wetsuit…kooked my way for a while and then got serious this fall/winter at LM and obsf…covid has been so fucking shitty but, Surfing changed my life and gives me so much meaning, it’s a really beautiful thing. 

So many people say OB is so gnarly…ya’ll trippin. It takes discipline and patience but the paddle outs aren’t even too bad with its sandy bottom. 

Today was the first long period swell day inna while and I am so stoked on those rides today..did you score? This week should be epic!"
2225,Can surfing only close out beach breaks hinder my progression…?,surfing,"I’ll preface this by saying I’m a kook. I’d like to think I’m self aware to know I’m a damn kook. I rode a wave storm for 4-5 months and then switched to a torq board. I’m still learning but I’ve caught some good waves trimming down the line. But I’m still trash for sure, still going out with the mindset to keep learning every time 

But today I was at La Jolla and the sets were just close out after close outs. If you did get on a wave it was like a 1.5 second ride on the face and then the wave closed out 

I started to wonder, am I hurting my progression only surfing close out beach breaks? I’m gaining experience reading waves and having fun but I can’t help but think I have no time on the face of the wave to actually ride or do any turns/cutbacks.

Am I overthinking this and I should just keep going out and learning? If I’m not overthinking it, can anyone recommend some spots in SD where I can go as intermediate-beginner and get a longer ride and practice some turns? Feel free to Pm if you don’t wanna publicly say your spot"

Should I hit it with some wetsuit cleaner to try and get rid of the smell, or do you think when I get it in the ocean, and actually hang it properly it’ll go away?"

My paddling arms were getting weaker and weaker everyday obviously as I'm not properly conditioned to it. When the session finished, going over the speed bumps hurt like hell on the way home and I couldn't breathe/cough/sneeze without my upper right rib hurting. Went to the ED and nothing's broken and 2 days later, no bruising. Thinking it could be intercostal muscle strain. Is it possible to get an intercostal muscle strain from just paddling and overworking the muscles associated with paddling? I didn't feel anything sore when I was actually surfing except for extremely lethargic arms by the end of it. The docs said it could take about a month to heal but I can still surf except it'll be very sore. Just wondering if anyone else has had a similar incident and how long it took to recover, etc."

I’m currently planning a trip in June for about a month, with the goal of staying in Airbnb, surfing daily and working on my Spanish.

I’m looking for recommendations for places to stay where I’d have access to reasonably mellow waves, at least at the beginning. I know swells get fairly heavy in June, but have read that Playa Gigante, with being close to playa Amarillo and sometimes Panga Drops, can be fairly manageable when other nearby places get big. I’ve also read that Maderas is a decent mellow break but that it’s a bit more isolated. I won’t have a car or moto, so Gigante seemed particularly nice because of walking distance to a few different breaks, though I know the town is fairly isolated. Would love some advice if anyone knows the area well around this time of year. Thanks!"

2462,San Francisco Old &amp; Fat Kook,surfing,"Hello new friends!
I am an old (42) and fat (195# 6’2) surfer getting back into the obsession after a 10 years dry docked. Seeking some advise. Thanks in advance! 

Ten years ago, I surfed almost every day at black point on O’ahu. Did so for ten years or so, but I recently put my fat ass on a longboard on kauai for the first time in many years and realized 1- I forgot everything 2- I’m out of shape….but the love returned hard. 

When I moved from Hawaii to sf I just couldn’t wrap my brain around the wetsuit and didn’t want to ruin all of the amazing Hawaiian memories sunset seared into my brain. 

But… after feeling the burn, and the thrills again, I sprung for a r4 hooded Patagonia suit.

So I come to you now with a couple questions:
1: what board should I buy? Cost matters but I’m not broke. My last quiver included an owl Chapman classic (for eating sht on the north shore) a George Ku longboard, and an aipa fish.  I could rip, could being the key word. 
The older I got, the more I loved the fish / longboard. 
I was cured of wanting another big wave board, after a near life liberating event.   
I live really close to OB (I know I’m too old / fat / rusty to paddle out there now, but I don’t have a lot of room for boards, so thinking I’d like to eventually be able to paddle out there when it’s not huge. I was thinking about another Ben aipa fish for big boys. It’s small but thick, and I was also thinking about a classic nose rider…. I’d like to buy something local to NorCal, but don’t really know the shapers. I have a preference to painted boards 🤪 because again, small apartment and am going to have to look at it all the time.

This leads me to my next question…
2- where should I surf? Bolinas looks like nice long comfortable rides, but hellla far.  Any pointers on where to paddle out in sf proper? 

Thank you!!! If you see an old fat man on a beautiful new board in an over priced wetsuit, shoot me a Shaka/fu ;)"

2465,Old man getting back onto it but confused with fin options.,surfing,"TL;DR Is there a 2+1 fin box set available for a soft/foamie longboard?  Or is it possible to get a circa 8"" fin for a FCS2 thruster centre fin box? Or is there a classic longboard centre fin box available for a foamie?

I havent surfed for 30 years. Kids, other stuff, you know how it goes.

So I found a softboard/foamboard 9' longboard in a neighbours rubbish collection and couldn't let it go to landfill. So I shoved it in the van. 

But the fins were all missing and the top foam layer was peeling away at the rails. I fixed the peeling layer and threw some boogie board fins on it and its been somewhat rideable for over a year now.

But now I want to do something about the fins. I see now there are FCS and FCS2 thruster fin box sets for foamies available these days. But how big a fin can I put on with that setup? Preferably I'd like around an 8"" middle fin.

I also see there are crappy plastic foamie through-plug 9"" single fins available on Amazon. But they seem very expensive for what they are. And I like the idea of easily removable fins for storage and packing better into the van when we go camping etc.

Ideally I'd like a 2+1 classic single fin/longboard fin box for a softboard. But I haven't been able to find one. I'm assuming this is what a ""FCS2 connect"" or ""FCS2 centre"" or ""FCS2 longboard"" longboard fin goes into? and that fin wont fit into the FCS2 centre box of a FCS2 thruster fin box set?

All these replacable fins are confusing for an old timer lol."
2466,Should I buy a skatey little shortboard?,surfing,"So I had a pretty good session this morning. Lots of waist-high beachbreak runners and hollow, very playful and low consequence surf. One wave lined up beautifully to give me a perfect launch ramp with tons of speed -- everything was too perfect NOT to try an air off. But I also happened to be on 40L of foam and I kicked that puppy off into the stratosphere rather than committing to the maneuver. Too scary! I also find it a little scary lip-lining the finish or doing an off-the-lip reentry on my backhand.

I have other boards, much more conventional shapes but I don't like them in small surf. My 40L board is amazing in conditions like today but it's not rippable at all. It looks like a bar of soap and not a surfboard! It is SUPER fast down the line but it's so much foam to manage underfoot. That board is a 5'11 but I surf it like a longboard -- fades, cheater 5's, whatever.

So I'm thinking about getting something way more loose. Like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt1uRPdj88Q). It looks so fun in small surf and I want to have a few more moves in my repertoire.

You ladies, gents, or other have any advice? Thanks y'all!"

2503,Tips for starting on unbroken waves?,surfing,"Hi there, I've been surfing about 3 weeks. I surf a classic 8ft foamie and I can stand up on the white wash \~90% of the time reliably. Recently, I've been going to a beach break where the waves break at about chest high and I've been trying to transition to unbroken waves on these. Generally 2-3ft high. However, I find myself out of position a lot of the time either too far forward and end up in the whitewash or too far to the side and just bob over the shoulder. I guess this would come down to learning how to read the waves over time. But when I do finally find myself at the top of the wave about to stand up, I just nose dive. I readjust my body before I start paddling so I'm a bit further back on the board but it happens again.  Am I not paddling fast enough? Or what is the golden time to stand up on the board? I've got it a couple of times out of luck I think and then just rode the wave straight towards the shore. When I do get it successfully, should I start turning the board to go down the line? I don't even know if what I'm saying makes sense right now.

Cheers"

2548,Unpopular opinion: SoCal sucks for surfing,surfing,"- super inconsistent, usually around waist high unless an unusually good year
 
- most places are insanely mushy with exception of a few spots 

- water is warmer than east coast but in 4/3 for half the year and we don’t get the warmth of east coast summer 

- quality is super low compared to other surf meccas like the Gold Coast, indo, hawaii, PR, Portugal etc…again with the exception of places like rincon

- crowds are insane and out of control pretty much anywhere there is a rideable wave no matter the size or conditions. So much so that driving and trying to park at any place is a disaster unless you surf mid day mid week. 

- cost of living is out of control 

Shocking ending comment: still the best place to live in America as a surfer. Great weather, mostly nice people, lots of surf variety and far more consistent than the east coast"

2566,Surfing a longboard in order to be a shortboarder,surfing,"I’m 19 and started surfing in April. Today I took out a 6’6 board. I finally got off the 8’ foamies and took a 6’6 hard board out for the third time. Another surfer who was really awesome and nice told me the board was too small for me. My pop up is a slow MESS. I pop up at the bottom of the wave instead of the top third because I wait for the board to be stable enough before popping up. Then when I pop up my foot positioning is off and I have to adjust it once I’m up and riding. My turns are good but I miss some waves because I can’t paddle into them.

This surfer suggested I get on a longboard for about a year. I said “but I want to be a shortboarder” and he said if I go to short boards now I will have bad technique and he said I should ride longboards and learn turns and floaters etc on those before going to a shortboard and then I will be a better shortboarder when I eventually make the change. 

The thing is I am so passionate about surfing and so hungry to surf shortboards and be good at it because it’s so FUN. So I want to move board sizes. I am just hungry to progress and felt a bit like it was time for me to get off the 8’ soft boards and get on to a shorter, hard board! I also know people who have been surfing about 3 years and are winning national competitions etc on a shortboard. 
Should I stick with the longer boards or persevere with the 6’6?

Also any pop up tips would be appreciated! I can never pop up at the top of the wave, I always pop up at the bottom of the wave lol"

2568,Why does my pop up suck?,surfing,"Hi everyone, I have been surfing in the Bay Area for over a year and just can't seem to pop up on my shorter board. I try to go regularly, at least 2-3x per week. Please help - it's so frustrating! Including the video below.

*Processing video 0jh9somlqy881...*

I moved down to a 6'6'' fish after riding a 8' wavestorm for a couple of months. After the switch it took me a while to catch waves but I do it consistently now and feel comfortable moving around in the water for proper positioning. HOWEVER, I always seem to struggle with my pop up and it is anything but consistent. When I take the wavestorm out in smaller conditions I find it easy to pop up on, &gt;60% of the time. Popping up on land, no problem. I have watched all of the videos, read all of the forums, and think I have a pretty good understanding of how to do it. In the water though, on the shorter board, everything falls apart. 

I bough a GoPro to record myself and found that in addition to what you see in the video here, I also have a tendency to put my back knee down and then bring it up, doing the pop up in 2 steps. It happens pretty quickly and I wasn't aware of it until I started taking videos. Now I try really hard not to put my knee down but it looks like I am jumping into position. Anyway, I can catch waves and surprisingly get up on them but I would really like to fix this as it's obviously limiting my progression.

&amp;#x200B;

So I started using a big fuck off long board (12' or something like that) to help me compensate for my lack of strength on my left arm. But I can't help but feel like I look like an amateur or look or whatever. I have good control over the board so I'm not hitting ppl when turning or steal waves or run people over who don't know how to avoid getting run over.

2599,Had quite the encounter at Queens in Waikiki today,surfing,"In Hawaii for the week and I was out for a few hours logging on some crappy rental board at queens. It was probably a 60/40 split local to tourist but I mean my etiquette is good and I know when to pull off the wave, even when the locals dropped in on me I didn’t even say anything and would take it with them. Everything was fine and everyone was getting along until an old Hawaiian man on a SUP paddled put to the outside where I was.
A set wave came and it lined up nicely for him to take so he starts paddling for it and shouts left so I think he’s going left so I take a few paddles and he yells me off it so I pull off, no big deal. He then comes back out and tells me I need to learn two things: safety and etiquette which I was just like “okay.” Another set wave comes further down right where nobody is so I paddle over to it and take it and when I come back outside and he’s now mad at me for apparently stealing all the set waves and lot sharing with anyone. He said a lot and at one point t even paddling over to me and grabbed my board so I couldn’t get away and just cussed me out and told me off for like 5 minutes straight.

Some of the things he said included:

- You white people come in with your shitty ass rental boards and ruin everything
- I used to drown white fucks like you especially before the pandemic
- I’ll hit you with my board or paddle I don’t care
- All you white people know is taking you never give 
- You just have to come outside and steal every set wave (proceeds to take every outside set wave himself)
- This spot is queens, royalty used to surf here before you white fucks ruined everything

So yeah that’s my story, pretty annoying because I was plenty respectful of the locals but he didn’t seems to think so. It’s been a dream of mine to log Waikiki for awhile so it was great until that came out of the blue."

2614,Lessons from 2021 for catching more waves,surfing,"I’ve been surfing a few years and I made some big leaps forward in 2021 in transitioning to shorter boards and reliably catching waves. I wanted to share three things that helped me catch more waves this last year. Curious to hear peoples thoughts and to hear other people’s lessons learned. 

1. Paddle HARD. I needed to push myself harder when paddling for waves. Sometimes I tell myself to move like I’m paddling for my life to get away from a shark. I catch way more waves when I really push hard. 

2. Look for the dark face on the wave. Reading waves and placing myself was a big challenge for me. This year I feel like I got a better visual sense for where to be on the wave. I’d describe the sweet spot I’m looking for these days as the place where the wave is steep enough that it’s face in that spot turns dark, I guess from less sunlight hitting it from above. 

3.  Look back at the wave over your shoulder when paddling. I already looked over my shoulder to check for other folks on the wave, but this year I started doing it to look at the wave while I’m paddling. This helps me makes adjustments to when to start paddling hard (see #1) and position myself into the right takeoff spot on the wave (see #2)."

2629,Used surfboard buying stories?,surfing,"Been a while (due to my extensive 5 minute internet research) since there were some posts in terms of sharing used surfboard selling and purchasing approaches and tits. People want to score deals but I think it’s important to pay a fair price for your board and life context. 

To start, I’ve found that the posts on OfferUp and Craigslist that get my attention have sufficient photos to communicate condition, and Dimensions are always important to share if possible. Beyond that, I really do hate the copy-paste tags that inevitably end up being recycled on CL posts and OfferUp to a lesser extent. Pretty much any term that makes it really annoying if I’m searching for something specifically. 

My last board purchase via OfferUp was from a young kid who shaped some boards, a rad neo-retro single fin that sold me on the Quality of construction with a great glassing schedule with volan fiberglass. It’s a fun shape that I would not have tried and i didn’t overpay fora great change-up board on the quiver. 

Love to hear what you guys have gone through recently or any rants or tips you guys have with used board buying online."

2640,A million questions about fins,surfing,"Ok look I apologize in advance for how many questions I have but how do I figure this shit out on my own!? I looked it up and just got more confused.

I lost a fin on my new Crime Big Fish twin fin  in the water recently literally ten seconds after bragging about how much i liked the twin set up vs a single fin  because (among other things) the fins wouldn't hit the rocks (can you guess what happened next) Almost instantly Poseidon put a rock in my path and I lost a fin. Also one min earlier I sliced my brand new wetsuit open. Unrelated but also a funny disaster. Ok so now i need to get new fins for my twin but i'm a little over whelmed by the choices. - i also have another new board which is a Mctavish Ray Gleave Model 9-5 long board- that I have some fin questions for too- If you're bored and not annoyed by how long this post is- I could use some advice! For full context I'm a so/so surfer on the low to middle end of intermediate( despite surfing for years) . I don't go out in big surf. The fish takes FCS 1 or 2 fins. 

1. Will any twin fin set do? My board is an 8/10 fish do I need a specific size fin?
2.  What the hell is a keel? Why would I want/not want them?
3. Is there a difference between the fins in a tri or quad set up or is it just that there are more fins in those? ( like if i found a good deal on a tri fin set could i just pop them in the twin or is that wrong)
4. The dude at Crime was like ""There are fun twin fin sets out there to experiment with. I like the looser twins with the long fish."" I was like ""yeah cool I love loose stuff"" but in reality-  I had no idea what he was talking about. What is a looser twin and is that bad or good for a surfer at my level?
5. Brands? I saw some that were cheaper at Pacific Vibrations but is that for a reason? What brand should I get?
6. Is it bad to buy used fins? 

Ok - onto the Mctavish Long board - the guy who sold it to me said that it had too much rocker to do a single fin set up.

1. Is that true? Will a single fin not work on a 9-5 with a lot of rocker?
2. whats the difference fun/perfomance wise between a tri fin thruster set and a 2+1 set up?  Which should I get?

Ok i think thats all my questions thank you for humoring me."

I am wondering if anyone has surfed these two models before, I'm considering getting myself a new board, I currently have 9'5 CJ neo classic model, it's a great board, but want to look for a board that has more ability in the nose.

Since there is no one around me has surfing the new model apex, so I'm hoping I can get some suggestions here.

I'm 5.9 feet tall, 167.55 lb weight, usually surf at the beach break, if I'm getting one of these 2 models probably go for the 9'6.

can anyone give me some suggestions should I go for apex or sprout?

following is the spec of the two models:

Yes I know, probably should've had a professional do it, but I don't use the board much and I want to learn how to repair. Everything went perfectly until I popped in the new fin; there's a slight gap between the fin and the board. If I rotate it towards the front, the front of the fin will sit flush but the gap appears on the back side. 

The gap is very slight, no more than an 8th inch tops. At first glance you can barely even tell. Will this really affect the ride noticeably enough to be concerned?

(Note: Both the fin and the plug are FCS and as far as I can tell, both plugs are aligned properly. I've read you can sand down the fin tabs to see if it'll sit deeper, that may be my next step.)"

2673,Twin fin placement on single fin surfboards,surfing,"Hey guys what are the general guidelines for twin fin placement on a surfboard? I want to add some futures fin boxes to a few single fin boards. Any rules of placement to follow? I read this from Greenlight surfboards.

:Fin placement really depends on our average back foot placement when you pop up. You want the fins slightly behind your rear foot for a twin set.

Somewhere around 7"" - 7.5"" up from the tail is a good place to put the trailing edge of the twin fins. For keels you want them back another inch since they have longer bases so 6"" - 6'5"" up from the tail.

Twin fins are supposed to be loose so you'll want 5 degree cant and 3/16"" toe-in. Keels are more of a down the line fin and need less toe-in and cant. 1/8"" Toe-in and 2-3 degree cant is good for them.

Be advised using standard side fins from a thruster set for a twin will not work as well as real twin fins. There is more surface area on twin fins that hold you in the wave, a standard thruster side fin will be difficult to make waves on.

The other is a 8'10"" Stewart single fin with somewhat rolled rails."
2674,Do you feel safe surfing completely alone?,surfing,"So I surf at weird times of the day/week/year and sometimes I end up being the only person out. Occasionally, it kinda scares me and I end up making my sessions shorter or just play around in the white water. 

Example:
Last time I went, the fog was super heavy, and I didn’t see a single soul as I walked the 40 minutes to my spot. Waves were head high/overhead, and the current was pretty strong. Paddled out, realized nobody would find me if the current brought me out to the sea (probably wouldn’t survive very long in 8 degrees water), and then fought the current for 30 minutes to get back inside. Walked back to the other side of the beach (only saw a woman and her two dogs, and a dead bird). Then I “surfed” broken waves in the shallow water for like two hours. Had some fun, I guess, but I wish I’d just swallowed my fear and surfed the good bois at my usual spot.

The more I’ve learned about boards and volume the less I understand this. 

In general, a hpsb should generally fit the curve and size of the wave. The most common shortboard sizes for advanced surfers I’d imagine are 5’7-6’1 

The average male weighs almost 200lbs, let’s just say the average adult surfer or athlete weighs a bit less @ 180. Even still most hpsb at 6’1 will be low in volume and probably too long for their home break (most of the surfing world dailys avg quality and size surf). 

Seems like it’d make a lot more sense for brands to offer 2 or even 3 variants in the most common sizes vs 6’4+ variants of models that don’t even function well as step ups.

Of course ordering custom is always an option but as someone who just broke 2 and has a 8 week lead time on a freshie can’t help but wish there were more options on the racks of surf shops."

2732,"Stuck in a mental funk, what do you do when you can’t surf?",surfing,"I’m not really sure what to do with myself right now and decided that outreach may help with some new perspectives. 
I recently moved to Alaska from Hawaii for some unanticipated life circumstances and I don’t mean to sound dramatic but I feel like I’m just eroding away as a person. 
Alaska isn’t unknown territory for me as I’ve lived here previously before moving to Hawaii, 
I’ve been doing my best to be resilient in the aspects of life but I am honestly just very unhappy right now. 
I have a good job, a new kitty at home and am doing my best to reestablish myself as one does after a big move. I just feel like I walked away from becoming the best person I was on track to being with surfing in my life, now that it’s gone my internal compass is broken and my mental health is degrading no matter the attempts to combat it. 
It’s affecting every aspect of my life, the alternatives to getting out here require a finacial commitment that are just out of reach at the moment.
If anyone has any insight, or has been through anything similar I’d really appreciate it if you’d be willing to share what helped."
2733,O'Neill psycho tech alternatives with more durability?,surfing,"I've bought O'Neill psycho Tech's exclusively for the last 7-8 years because they fit me very well. I'm tall with very long arms. And imo they're the best suit ever... For a year. After that they wearout quickly and loose a lot of warmth. I noticed that their newer ones with technobutter 3 are the worst durability wise. It will eventually start to disintegrate especially in the shoulders. The 3/2, that recently wore to it's grave and threw out, had see through shoulders and I almost completely ripped off the bottoms of the legs at my calves due to it tearing easily after a while. Their Technobutter 2 suits didn't seem deteriorate so drastically, while they didn't get stiffer over time. 

Anyways anyone have any brand recommendations that make good flexible and durable rubber these days? I'm considering trying out Patagonia since they use different materials than most brands."

2735,Deciding on a new one board quiver. Board advice or reviews welcome. Probably a Pyzel.,surfing,"So I've been riding a 5'11 [Chilli Churro](https://www.boardcave.com/churro) for the past year. \[  5' 11""   19 7/8""   2 7/16""   30.5L  \]

Really loved the board and still had a lot of learning to do on it solidifying my maneuvers and getting properly acquainted with my backside. But unfortunately I no longer have the board, and cannot buy easily in my country.

So I still need something with a good amount of volume (28.5 - 30L) and not too drawn in on the tail. Waves at my LB are fair to good, between 2-4Ft.

My LSS have a good selection of Pyzels and I'm looking at a 5'9 [Phantom](https://www.boardcave.com/churro) \[ 5' 9""   19 1/4""   2 7/16""   28.6L \] or \[  5' 10""   19 1/2""   2 1/2""   30.1L  \]. I know the Phantoms have insane reviews. Would be good to hear from you guys also.

The [Pyzalien 2](https://www.boardcave.com/shop/brands/surfboard-brands/pyzel-surfboards/pyzalien-2) also looks like a slightly thicker intermediate board \[  5' 9""   19 1/8""   2 7/16""   28.9L  \]

The Phantom looks like it still has plenty of width towards the tail which would make the transition from my Churro fell more natural, as I'm definitely not looking for a high performance board. I'm happy with steep drops left and right, pumping on waves is good, my cutbacks are ok, but getting better every session, and I'm a strong paddler.

Hope one of you filthy animals has a nugget of wisdom for me. I'm definately open for suggestions outside of Pyzel, these just seem to be easily available to me right now."

I was so used to that from Vancouver Island, and visiting Oregon.

I recently went to `Costa Rica` so I would like to try a different location.

2745,Dickhead surfers make learning almost impossible.,surfing,"Where to begin, I’m mostly posting this to vent but to also get some feedback. I’ve been surfing consistently for about a year in SoCal and feel fairly comfortable on catching a wave and not getting in someone’s way. However, I feel like giving up because I’m at a point where I want to get better but every time I go out I get cussed out by some egotistical asshole. I get it, I’m still new - I have a wavestorm and I’m trying to learn. You want this beautiful 2-3 foot wave all to yourself - fine. Half the time I’m laughed  at because of my board, which I find hilarious. Or the other half I’m somehow cussed at for catching wave even if I’m clearly not in the way. These “local” guys who are willing to start fist fights over 2-3 foot waves are ridiculous. Can someone not even be able to learn anymore? 

What sucks is I don’t even want to continue going out because it’s been exhausting dealing with these assholes. My dad was a surfer back in the 60s and for Christmas got me a nice fiberglass Almond Board which I’m so stoked on but I’m almost embarrassed to even take it out because I’m still new and know I’m just going to just get cussed out. 

I want to get better and those few moments of catching a wave blocking out the assholes are almost spiritual. However, the other 90% of the time feels like I’m fighting for territorial rights. 

How did you guys get past that learning stage with jerks in the water?"

2834,How to get comfortable surfing head high + waves,surfing,"I’ve always liked sharing this advice to those who are nervous to leave the waist high level. 

If you’re already surfing waist high waves (3-4ft), a head high is only about 2.5ft higher. A head high wave is the perfect wave, especially in glassy conditions. You don’t really get thrown around too bad, solid ride time, and pushes you to ride larger waves.

The best way to overcome the fear is to try it, obviously. But I found it very helping watching videos of people surfing head high waves. Watching how short of time surfers are actually underwater for and realizing it’s not scary, it looks fun.  For example https://youtu.be/oDrNvPHBxrQ at :40 seconds, that’s a perfect head high, and if you fall, you’ll be fine. Just make sure you’re in shape!

If there’s 6+ waves in not so clean conditions and you haven’t been surfing that long, I’d work your way up to that. But no reason to be afraid as a beginner in good conditions and a solid group with you. Send it, and you’ll progress way faster.

I'm relatively old for a new surfer (I think?) in my mid-30s and haven't stayed a hostel since my early 20s. Has anyone done this camp recently? If so, what was your impression of the experience? I'm mainly just looking to get fundamentals so that I can create a foundation to learn for the future."

I started with the classic 8' Wavestorm and I learned quickly how to catch waves, drop and the basics. I started chasing bigger waves and I also got the hang of it relatively fast. Everyone around me told me to get a short(er) board to start transitioning but I really like to soft top world, I believe for beginners like me I don't have to worry about damaging it too much and I feel more comfortable trying new things. So I started looking for the best board to transition and I think I came up with three choices that seem pretty reasonable ... the 6'0"" wave bandit ben gravy performer (tri fin), the 5'6"" wavestorm fish, or the 6'0"" catch surf odysea fish.

Now that I need to buy a board, I was eyeing this longboard 9’4 MPE ruler for the simple reason that some local surfers said I may learn quicker on a long board vs a mini mal.

2865,What fin set up for a custom fish?,surfing,"I’m looking at buying a fish and have the option of a twin, quad or 5 fin set up. I can’t really see myself using this as a thruster so should i be disregarding the 5 fin option? The guy at the shop said to just go the 5 fin option because it gives me the most options, but I’m worried I may end up with a board trying to be an everyday, thus mediocre at everything, board. Will going a 5 fin and only using it as a quad or twin have any detriments?

I plan to use this board as my groveller, small wave board and speed is definitely the priority. So what I’m asking is, if I won’t use it as a thruster ever, should it come down to twin VS quad? And if that’s the case, what should I take into consideration when deciding between twin or quad."

I tend to do well in the 1-3 ft swells and don't push beyond that. And it all depends on how big it is when it hits the shore (the surf reports are sometimes way off with 1-2 ft days having sets that are substantially overhead).

I'm generally OK but prefer low tide because it's easier to get back to shore so I can worry less about the leash breaking but the one thing I find is that choppy, windy days are sometimes scary as hell. Water seems to be moving in every direction, waves are unpredictable and I worry that I might get pulled out to sea and wind up re-enacting Castaway without even so much as a Wilson to keep me company.

I know the seaside can actually be somewhat a daily driver, but it needs to be smaller, mine is a little big for my weight (35 liters) so when its kind of hollow it just go way too hard lmao

I'm a beginner-transitioning-to-intermediate (e.g. recently moved to hard board, still a kook though) looking to spend the summer holidays in a place that offers good, acceptably regular conditions for learning (i.e don't want to spend 2 weeks in the whitewater, nor in double-overhead swell). 

I live in Europe and I've been told to check out Ireland. But I also read that Madeira was a great place for surfing, with warmer water (the book is called Barbarian Days, by W Finnegan - I'm sure some of you know it). 

Would anyone be able to guide me on my choice?

Most people will say it’s trash after it’s waterlogged, but for me that’s not the case. Here’s what i did to drain the water out; leave your board sitting for a while upright so that the water drains downwards. Put a paper towel underneath so you can visualize how much water actually comes out. Switch the paper towel every day. By about a week, you’ll notice that the water is coming out less and less. Wait till no water is coming out. It should feel way lighter than it first did, and i wish i used a scale to see how much weight was lost due to the water. Once it’s done draining, either use a hot glue gun to patch the holes, or use gorilla glue. Hope this helps."

Any ideas on what to look for in a do it all step up? I primarily surf in SoCal but I've been hitting some PNW spots recently too. I've noticed that my regular 5'10"" 27L shortboard doesn't really cut it a lot of the time up there. The waves can be quite large and fast, but also tend to stay pretty soft. There's also a lot of pretty spread beach breaks up there, so I'd like something a little more mobile. Given that I also surf in California and sometimes Hawaii, I'd like a board that would work well in steeper, punchier waves, too.

&amp;#x200B;

I've never bought a dedicated step-up before. What dimensions should I be looking for in relation to my shortboard? I've noticed a lot of step-ups in shops tend to be wider than I was expecting. I was thinking something around 6'4"" 30L.

2993,Foam Funboard good for beginner surfer?,surfing,"I'm starting my surfing journey, and wondering what board I should be purchasing. 

Had some lessons with my friend and her board, but I'd like to get my own so I can go out and practice without needing her everytime!
I've been reading online, and overwhelming information says 8-9ft foam boards with losts of litres is the way to go for beginners learning to surf. However, it also says that you can grow out of them very quickly if you're wanting to eventually progress to a shortboard, as the manoeuvreability is basically non-existent.

So my dilemma is what board should I buy that is appropriate for learning on, but also provides a good segway into surfing at a more intermediate level once at that stage. 
In a perfect world I'd get a foam long board and learn on that before then moving onto something smaller, but if what I'm reading is true and I will grow out of it quicky for the goals I want, then it seems like a wasted investment at the prices I've found them (there also unfortunately isn't a surf shop that can rent me one close to my area).

SO, what I'd like to ask is if a foam 'funboard/mini-mal' is a suitable option? Something I can learn fundamental basics on, but also something that will carry me through for a long period of time while I continue learning with the goal of eventually shortboarding. And if it is suitable, what litre would be recommended for it (I'm 70kg at 180cm)?"

This winter in particular, I’ve been so close to exploding out on the water with guys that have zero etiquette. I know SoCal surfers could be complete dicks.  But the same respect you give people out in the lineup isn’t reciprocated. I usually don’t give a shit and just go about my happy day. But not as of lately.

How do you guys deal with surfers with zero etiquette/snakes in a civil way?

3037,Looking to treat myself this Christmas with a new cozy wetsuit. Need some insight,surfing,"TLDR; looking for high end wetsuit recommendations for daily use in SD. Deciding between billabong, feral, need essentials, and ripcurl. 


Hi I’m in San Diego I’m looking to get a higher end wetsuit and my budget is 400$ or less. I usually surf dawn patrol and sometimes twice a day. I have pretty broad shoulders so my current wetsuit (size Medium) was tight on my upper body at first but stretched out as time went on. My cheap backzip 4/3 suit is starting to fall apart and be shitty.

I want to treat myself and get something nicer. I was thinking 3/2 wetsuit because in my mind a really nice 3/2 == shitty 4/3 but idk how true that is.

I used the search bar as well as watched the stab wetsuit guide. Here are the ones I found most recommended: 

- need essentials - the price point is fantastic on these. Anyone have some insight on the liquid taped/steamer models? I dig that they don’t advertising, i fucking hate ads. The liquid taped one mentions a key ring where the steamer model does not

- Rip curl flashbomb - I see this one recommended a lot on Reddit. I’ve seen that there is an ripcurl outlet by USD where I could go try it on and maybe get a better discount deal? What’s better for these, no zip or front zip? Is there a car key ring loop? 

- Billabong furnace natural - saw this one mentioned in the stab wetsuit video. I like that it’s made out of recycled material. No clue if it’s got a car key ring loop? 

- Feral - I’m highly considering these or need essentials. They look really cozy, flexible, and premium. They were highly talked about in the stab wetsuit guide and they have a car key ring loop. It’s 400$ but I’m okay with that if it’s worth it. 

I always surf mornings so maybe a 4/3 is necessary but I’m not sure. I was thinking about picking a need essentials 3/2 and 4/3 chest zip. Two suits for about the price of one feral. I was thinking I’d use the 3/2 most days and then bust out the 4/3 if it’s chilly. Thanks for anyone that has some insight"

3055,Epoxy Board Ding Repair Nightmare,surfing,"Any advice is much appreciated.

I bought an epoxy longboard a few months ago and fell in love with it. Tons of float, paddling was so easy, could get into waves I had no business standing up on. I started to notice the board becoming harder to paddle, I thought it may have just been in my mind.

One day I’m out and there is very clear discoloration near the right rail, pretty obvious and I’m pretty sure it’s some sort of waterlogging. In hindsight I probably surfed with it 1-2 times prior with it in the same condition, do you think I’ve done permanent damage? It was one of the most expensive things I’ve ever bought, so I’d be bummed.

There APPEARS to be a small crack in the rail which is letting water in, it is tiny so I could be wrong. Has anyone had any luck repairing epoxy boards? Do you think it will ever surf the same or did I shoot myself in the foot?

I’ll buy a ding kit but I’ve heard they’re not super effective in my area (New England) because they need sunlight to cure. One friend suggested ducttape, but I have no idea if that would be watertight. 

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated, I’ve been letting it dry for about a week with the waterlogged rail facing down, so I’m confident I’ve gotten all the water out of it I can."

I’m aware that sometimes the best measure if there’s a chance for a collision is to just take the pounding of the whitewash. However, on big days the speed of play is so much higher I worry that heading for the whitewash is almost more confusing to the guy on the wave - keeping a straight line being so predictable. There’s also more room to play with so I feel it’s less likely to ruin a ride if adjustments are made for passing surfers.

Anyone out there might be able to answer me a few questions?

- Is the ""cheapest"" option for boards doing a week long rental, buying a craigslist board and donating it to a shop / kid when I'm done with it, or sucking it up and investing in a good travel bag / risking a bit of board damage? I don't usually like to fly with boards, but I've never had a great travel bag, either...
- How bad is the rainy season? Since it's not really a sightseeing trip, it doesn't seem like it would bother me unless I need to stay out of the water, like you do (should) in SoCal. From what I've gathered, seems like no one stays out over there.
- Comfortable up to HH-OH when surfing over a reef - is it reasonable to think I can stay in Honolulu and score up to those conditions most days with an hour or so of driving, max?
- Anything else I should be aware of / consider?

The only thing I have are locking Yakima Ripcord straps, tie downs , and a tailgate pad.  This works for most of my boards, but I’ve got a 9’8 that’s kind of a 60’s pig design with a lot of weight towards the tail.  I don’t feel confident in driving 20 min to the beach with that. 

Any recommendations on good rack ideas for it? I was looking at some of the Yakima bed racks or maybe an extender."
3110,Be careful in Costa Rica,surfing,"Took another trip to Costa Rica, surfed Playa Hermosa today. I'm always very careful to never leave anything visible in a rental car. On international trips. I always hide the minimal important stuff like ID and cash in hard to find places, like behind spare tire panels. This way anyone walking by sees a completely empty car.   


Came back from a noon time session and found that someone jacked the drivers side door handle and went through the car, finding this stuff. Now, CR requires that in order to drive you have to have a drivers license AND a passport with you at all times, so that was in there too. Thieves took everything EXCEPT passport and vaccine card.   


Aggravating for sure, but I'm grateful they left me a way out, and nobody got hurt.  :/"

He was already riding the wave as I was paddling out. It was about to break and he was in the shoulder of the wave. I had already established my line that i was taking as i paddled up and over the cresting wave. He had space to easily go around me, but decided to turn right at me and his fin sliced my foot. I've noticed good surfers often like to do this - they turn towards you and just miss, perhaps as a way to show off.

I'm on vacation in Hawaii with the wife and kids and got the thumbs up to head up to Hanalei Bay for some morning surf. I've surfed a longboard most my life but am still a kook and rented a board that I'm comfortable on. 

Im not trying to paddle to the proper break and opt for the beach break. At first it's a very non-local vibe, everybody is cool and pretty friendly - all is good. I head in for 20 mins to play with the kids on the beach and my wife says I'm surprised youre not out - so out I go! 

When I get back out, I'm pretty much the only one there for 10 mins and then a few guys start paddling out. One guy is a short boarder and probably a transplant local but certainly not Hawaii and I just get a real aggressive vibe from him like he's crowding me and just realto me. He paddles inside on a wave I'm paddling for and just blatantly snakes me without even trying for the wave. I don't say a thing because, w/e I'm on vacation, have caught a ton of waves and don't need trouble from this asshole.

That's that, don't get a look from him, and he pretty much just goes away after that. I was displaying decent etiquette the whole time I'm out, except for maybe I'm catching too many waves but what can I say, if something looks catchable, I'm typically going to paddle for it.

Was I just having too good a time and someone wanted to put a stop to it or am I reading too much in to it?"

Too cold, too crowded, blowing to hard offshore, tide dropping fast, etc. So I got in my warm car with heated seats and drove back to work. I started thinking about all of the fair weather surfers that disappear when the water temp drops that first 5 degrees and I wonder what they do during the off season to stay fit. I would assume cardio, like walking, running, or swimming. Maybe doing burpees or other strength training. doing pop ups in your living room, and also skating (skate boarding). But not surfing for 6 months leaves a pretty big void. What else do you do?

Tips for setting up a (very tiny, apartment-sized) shop space?",surfing,"Recently I helped a buddy lay a couple grunge pads on the hulls of some kayaks he had in his shop so that I could start learning how to repair my own boards. We were using Dynel and epoxy. It was pretty straightforward: measure, cut Dynel, lay tape, mix epoxy, layer epoxy over the Dynel, dry, fill the weave with thick epoxy + graphite filler, dry a bit, remove tape and wipe excess with white vinegar (works great), dry, then sand down. Easy peasy. 

Question 1: can I just use the same process more or less for board repair? What if anything would be different? For example: I heard you can't use fiberglass on epoxy boards and vice versa. Is that true? How do you cure the fiberglass if you can't use epoxy?

Question 2: Buddy has industrial products and materials in the shop. How do I scale down for home use and what would I need to make a tiny but functional shop on my apt-sized back porch?

I haven't been back in the water, but planning to do so tomorrow. Any ideas I should try? Should I cover the holes I made with duct tape or something? There's resin on them, so they seem water tight, but still...

3204,Second board for begginer/intermediate,surfing,"I've been surfing for 9 months now, initially on surf school boards (everything from 9' to 7') and for the past 6 months I've been riding a Decathlon 7'8"" foamie (75l). I'm starting to consistently catch and ride waves anywhere from knee high to slight overhead (mostly spilling waves), and though I still have a lot to improve, I'm starting to feel like the board is holding me back, particularly because I fell it turns like a bus. I surfskate and the feeling of responsiveness I get with surfskates is nothing I've experienced in the water and something that comes more naturally to me. I also struggle on breaks that are a bit more hollow, with the board nosediving very easily. Would also be nice to try to duckdive on bigger swells and not get stuck on the inside attached to a transatlantic liner. An added bonus would be not to have to prove myself to the idiots in the lineup riding hardboards who see the cheap foamie, assume I won't make it into the face and just drop in on me at the start of every session (many of them much worse surfers than me).

What do you think I should get? I'd want it to be a progressive steppingstone in the right direction and not a radical change, so I'm thinking something like a 6'6"", around 50l, and keeping it a thruster setup (not convinced a twin fish is the right thing). Any suggestions for actual boards are welcome. I'm currently eyeing an Alone Captain but am thinking maybe a smaller foamie would do the trick and have other advantages.

The waves looked pretty tricky but I decided to paddle out cuz I hadn't been out in quite a while. The crowd was pretty heavy for this spot, and all the ""locals"" were out there. I was just minding my business waiting for A LONG TIME for the right wave to come through, and all of a sudden this beautiful left came right at me. I was in the perfect position, and was well on the inside of everyone else looking at it. One of the ""locals"" who was further out on the shoulder than me decided he wanted it too, and started paddling hard. I knew I had the inside, so I took it, and just as I started to pop up, the guy tried to grab my foot and missed, and then he grabbed my leash and yanked it HARD. I got bucked off my board and took a nasty over the falls wipeout. Let me just mention that I am 14 YEARS OLD and this guy is in his late 40's to early 50's. I am an experienced surfer who has been surfing for 6 years and I know I did nothing wrong in terms of etiquette to piss anyone off in the lineup. Just because you consider yourself a ""local"" in the lineup doesn't mean you have the right to take any wave you want. I don't know if he did this because I am a young kid and he knows I can't really do much about it, but it doesn't matter. I just wanted to let anyone who does this in the lineup know that crap like that totally ruins someone's session. There are enough waves to go around. Luckily I was able to catch a bomb set wave which cheered me up :)

Did an emergency run back to the car to wax up the back and that seemed to sort it out. Out for an hour and caught 2-4 solid waves in my opinion. Have progressed from riding whitewash although did start this morning riding a couple of white wash waves because I have not been out for a while.

A couple of questions 

- when swimming out to a good point typically 5m away from where they break I tend to spend a lot of time getting pushed back 

- I have trouble knowing when I am on a wave and tend to miss a lot as a result I implement deep strokes and feet kicking but can’t seem to get any power

This sub really pushed me to consider giving surfing a shot for the first time! Super grateful for everyone here, I've learned a lot from your posts. Now I'm asking for some specific advice!

I'm considering going down to Rincon, PR for 4-6 weeks February - March. This is is basically the only time in my education I'll be able to surf consistently in a tropical location for a month or more, so I really want to take advantage of it.

I understand that Rincon has a TON of different breaks, but my worry is that conditions in February might be out of my skill level. Some of what I've read online and seen on YouTube makes it seem like Rincon really explodes in Feb. I'm mostly interested in developing a strong longboard foundation in waves ideally no more than chest high.

Here are my main questions:

* Will I be able to find 2-4 days/week of 2-4ft swell during the month of February at one or more of the breaks around Rincon?
* Does anyone have recommendations on any local surf coaches to get a few lessons from so I can get the lay of the land/make sure I'm abiding by local norms and etiquette?
* Is another part of the island possibly better for my skill level in February?

About me:

* Still improving my paddling stamina
* Most comfortable in 2-4ft swell
* Have logged a total of roughly 25 sessions on the water
* Surfed for the first time in my life in Carizalillo, Puerto Escondido for 2 weeks this summer
* Have surfed here and there throughout the fall in New Jersey
* Plan to bring my own longboard
* Conversational in Spanish
* Have spent time in PR including Rincon, so am generally familiar with the island, but this was before I ever tried surfing

Thanks in advance for your input!"
3217,Surfing and heart health,surfing,"Started surfing in my early 20’s, now I’m pushing 40. I find that at my age, I over exert myself more easily than when I was younger. I ride short boards, so I like to push myself when I’m in the water. However, I have noticed that at my age, if I push too hard and for too long, my heart rate won’t come down for hours. If I go for 2-3 hour sessions, my heart will hover around 80-110 for a few hours before dropping to 60-70’s. I’ve been checked by doctors several times to be certain I’m ok. They say nothing is wrong and my heart is fine. I do feel great otherwise, just makes me anxious. I try to avoid vigorous evening sessions now, otherwise it’s hard to get to sleep at night."

I've been looking at Lafitenia in the Basque Country and the forecast for the day I'm targeting is 6.5' @ 13 seconds with light offshore winds and an 8 AM low tide. Seems like really great conditions, and I'm regular so I really wanna take advantage of the region's best (and only consistent?) right point, but some local friends have warned me that they rarely surf the spot bc it's deceptively hard/dangerous.   


Anyone have any experience with the spot? What's so tricky about it? I know the takeoff is pretty steep &amp; rocky but I figured I'd just sit a little inside towards the shoulder at first to feel it out. Am I being stupid? Is it really drifty or anything?

So, I went into my local diving shop to look @ wetsuits and stuff and came out pretty informed but with questions for the community.

Details:

* In south Portugal (water is ~15 celcius in winter, 21 in summer)

* I have fairly good cold tolerance (from Canada, swim nude for ~15 minutes in this climate)

* For surfing, swimming, spearfishing, kayak adventures - I would like multipurpose if that's possible since I'm quite active.

* Budget around $100-$300 at top end



Is 3mm good enough or would it be too cold, would 5mm be too restrictive? 

Is wearing merino wool underlayers (briefs, shirt, etc) beneficial to improving thermals?

My local store has some items for offer for nice prices and I'd really like to support local rather than buy online from megashop - [are these wetsuits good](https://www.pinguimsub.pt/product/physical-products?category=product-category-3-mm-wetsuits)?  They seem nice in person, however I don't know quite what I'm looking for really.

Very much appreciate some help and guidance here! About ready to pull the trigger so I can get back in the water for longer :)"

After that instead of going out and entering from the current i tried to paddle right back out afyer the fall and took 3 waves on my head and got pounded so hard i got flatenned on the ground 3 meters under the water, idk what i wouldve done if i lost grip of my board.

My board was too small for the big fast waves and it was either i wont catch no waves or i will be where it breaks on my head.

And the worst thing, i was scared as fuck. I havent surfed my shortboard in 4 months cause it needed raparing and i used my new longboard, and i wasnt used to it. And i havent surfed waves like this since before the pandemic and even then it was less scary.

3290,TIDAL WAVES AND TIDAL BORES,surfing,"Hi Surfers of reddit! Did you know that the tides we use to decide when is the best time of the day to surf for a specific spot, are actually caused by the gravitational forces of the moon and sun as well the rotation of the earth! So intriguing right? These tides are actually giant waves themselves and a low tide would be considered the trough, or lowest part of a wave and a high tide would be considered the crest. It is very hard to visualize the tides we use to decide when to surf waves, actually being very long waves that move across our oceans. One digestible way to understand this is through tidal bores. I would recommended checking out this video by Dylan Graves and Vans [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5d3nD0c1IE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5d3nD0c1IE)  ,where they surf a tidal bore. Throughout this video you can see a surfable wave created by a Tidal Bore as it pushes through the Severn river in south western England. This tidal bore serves as a great example of visualizing the movements of ocean tides, as it is an example of a rising high tide, where the tidal bore increases the depth of water in the areas it travels through. This is similar to the process that occurs in the ocean with rising high tides as a long tidal wave slowly increases the water level near the beach. This increase in water from high tides at beaches can occur once or multiple times a day depending on if the location you are at has diurnal tides, semi diurnal tides, and mixed times. Altogether I would recommend educating ourselves more about tides, swells, bathymetry, winds and different things that play a large role in controlling the waves we surf. New post coming soon!

Triathlon is my main hobby, so I'm a decent swimmer, but I don't want to do anything unsafe. 

The local beginner-friendly beach near me is called Otter Rock, so I was thinking of waiting for favorable conditions and then heading out with the bodyboard. Is that a terrible idea? If not, [ am I correct to say the favorable conditions I should wait for are modest swell sizes, with swell periods around &gt; 10 seconds, and offshore winds?](https://magicseaweed.com/Otter-Rock-Surf-Report/317/) Is there a maximum swell height I should consider for safety? Looking at the link above, the first day the winds are good also has a swell height of 16+ft so that seems scary.

Done a bit of research but mainly just found explanations for fin set ups, so was hoping for some advice or people’s personal experiences.

Is it worth upgrading the middle fin to something bigger/longer? Is 7’6” too short to be considered a long board (heard it described as a mini mal)? And if I was going to go for a longer fin on that 7’6” board, do I keep the two side fins to make a weird thruster or ditch those and go the single?

3346,Step up vs mini gun,surfing,"I was recently handed down a 7’6” mini gun and trying to figure out if and when I’d use it. I already have a 6’4” step up for OB SF, I tend to pull it out for days in the 5-7 ft range cuz I’m a weekend warrior, although I know that rippers will use step ups for much larger surf than 5-7 ft. I don’t usually surf if it’s bigger than that, but I’m realizing I’ve also never had a board that could handle it.

Is the minigun overkill for days in the 6-8+ range? More importantly, will I be publicly shamed for bringing it out if it’s not triple overhead howling super tubes???

Surfers with both step ups and mini guns when do you choose one vs the other?"

Bonus: they add +1 warmth inside your boots. My shoe size is 9.5 and size M fits just right.  


**DRY THE BOOTS AND GLOVES FASTER** \- Sure, you can turn your gloves inside so they dry, but then you're stressing the seams like a knuckle-dragger. Then you stuff your boots with newspaper, right? Wrong.  They both end up smelling like the dagobah system because they never completely dry. Don't fret.

Further, I know that libtech (unclear about C4) treats its employees well and has stayed in the same area of washington state as the rest of the industry goes overseas. 

But! I’m planning on covering up ol’matty’s logos, not because it accomplishes anything concrete but it might make me feel better and prevent anti-vaxers from trying to give me a fist bump. 

So, how best to do this? Stickers? White airbrush? Also, if anybody has a recommendation for a california shaper who 1. Makes boards that go

I was surfing for more than a month when i started feeling my right rib hurt a little bit, but my friends insisted that it was normal, so i continued for some weeks until i couldnt handle anymore. The pain started to spread to the left rib and it was hurting even when i laid in my bed. The contact of my ribs with the board hurt a lot. I went to the doctor and he said it's an inflamation of the rib cartilage, something like that. I took some anti inflamatorys and stopped surfing for a month. The pain got better but when i pressed the ribs with my hand it still hurt a little. I went surfing once after this month to test it out and it got worse. Today its a month from that last session and the pain is in the same state it was when i decided to test it. I already did X ray and it didnt detect a single thing and went again to the doctor and he repeated the diagnosis.

None of my friends had this, and i'm starting to freak out and think i wont be able to surf anymore. The pain is tolerable when i wait some days, but its never 100% better and it always gets worse. I've decided i'll try surfing once a week in short sessions, even with the pain, but i dont know if i should, actually.

The place does have a private roof deck, and I was thinking about getting some weather proof deck boxes, the type people might store outdoor furniture cushions in, but would need them to be long enough to store an 8 footer. Something like this but bigger: [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09K9141DW/ref=sbl\_dpx\_outdoor-storage-deck-box\_B08KTQZ73W\_0](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09K9141DW/ref=sbl_dpx_outdoor-storage-deck-box_B08KTQZ73W_0)  


We will have closet space, but the deck has an area that would be ideal for something like this, and will already be somewhere we store cushions and stuff anyway.

Obviously the easiest fix is a hat (which I’ve got) but sometimes I don’t feel like wearing it especially when the waves get slightly bigger

I’ve used the search bar and people have recommended the following:

- blue lizard 
- surf durt
- surf mud
- head hunters 
- vertra 
- Sun bum 

I’m sure I’m missing some but these were the most common. I’ve tried Sun bum spf 50 lotion and blue lizard but I felt like both washed easily. I tried Surf durt and it was okay but I’m worried about it only being spf 30. The one that worked well for me was an invisible (which ironically is not invisible at all) zinc spf 50 but I don’t think it’s reef safe 

I’ve gravitated towards lotions rather than sticks because my ears get badly burnt and it’s easier to lather up my ears with lotion. Thanks for any input and yes I’m a kook"

3553,Took a fin through the leg,surfing,"Hi folks! I thought I would ask my question here because I just wanted to get a sounding board of other surfers. As I sat in the ER with bandages and tourniquet on my leg, I asked them how often they got surfers with fin injuries and they said it was extremely common. I basically popped off the wave of my life, straight into a massive set wave. I knew that lip was landing on my head so I bailed the board and then in the ground pound was slammed straight into my board. Fin box ripped off and theres a nice hole in my wetsuit. 

How often does this happen and what can I do to stop kooking on this? I've listened to pros about the impact zone and negative pockets of space to duck dive into, but it seems like there's this common thing that everyone has gone over the falls backwards, people do bail and then get pounded anyway etc. I know there's a positioning element to it, i.e. you learn where the bad positions are and start to steer clear, but how many of you have take a fin to something? Is it just part of the learning process if you start after your early/teen years? Do you have any advice beyond just ""if the lip is gonna fall on you, bail"". Like is it a good idea, if you can see this ahead of time, to just paddle straight toward the beach and hope for the best?"

I have never been surfing before in my life. I signed up for surf lessons at Waikiki Beach next week. But it will be raining the day of my lesson according to the forecast (and the forecast says it will be raining for most of my trip). So my question is, is it a bad idea to take beginner surfing lessons during rain? Should I cancel my surf lesson?

My initial concern was that I'd slip or whatever on the surf board during rain. But after going down the Google rabbit hole, I'm seeing things about pollution runoff after rain storms. Risks of getting sick, and seems like murky waters can attract sharks? Is there anyone who surfs Waikiki Beach, and knows if runoff after it rains is an issue in Waikiki Beach that I should take seriously? And if it's serious enough to cancel a surf lesson, should I also avoid swimming and wading in the water altogether since it's supposed to rain frequently?

Sorry, I don't know if this is a valid concern or if I'm being ridiculous haha. I've never lived near the ocean, and like I said, I've never gone surfing before. Any help is greatly appreciated, thank you in advance."

3575,Getting juiced by shaper?,surfing,"I live on the big island and ordered a board from a shaper on Oahu. He’s known for his longboards and I have a number of friends who ride/have ridden for him. I ordered a longboard for my girlfriend as a Christmas gift and received it about a week ago and when I opened the package I was surprised at the condition the board was in. Structurally it was completely fine and exactly what I was looking for but visually it was nothing like how it looked on the pictures. The airbrush coloring is noticeably faded and I can clearly see where the price tag was taped to the board. It looks like the board was sitting on the rack where sunlight was shining on half of it which caused the color to noticeably fade.

I called the shop and the guy who sold me the board says that he didn’t notice the fading as the lighting in their shop is bad. I figured that this was reasonable. What caught me off guard was when after he talked about the lighting he went on to tell me that it’s a handmade board and they are never perfect. Which I also somewhat understand. But, the final straw was when he went ahead and told me that it’s only the color of the board and the board itself is fine. I finally told him that a brand new $1,200 board should be just that, BRAND NEW. I told him that I would send the board back and I wanted a full refund. As this is a gift and I am not about to give my girlfriend a faded board. He’s saying he’ll refund me but that I need to pay for shipping. 

My question is, should I have to pay for shipping?"

If so, does this mean that select stretch of coast will be packed with all the surfers? Or could enough of the ENE swell filter down to some of the spots around Rincon to make them fun? (The forecast there is looking less promising.) And are all the north-facing north shore spots totally blown out when the trade winds blow?

3583,Etiquette question,surfing,"For the first time in my life I have surfed consistently for about 4 months plus trained in the pool like 3 times a week. Turns out that has led to an unforseen set of problems. 

Our local spot can be a bit finicky and on certain days it'll be like 3-4 good waves in an hour. 

Somehow I'm now usually the most active and fastest paddler in our spot, ( Beach break with 1.5 peaks).  When I was in the canaries and the waves were infrequent the best paddlers usually just battled to be deeper in the wave and whoever was deepest basically won.

I started doing this but recently my friend called me out for ""taking all the waves"" there were only couple people in the water but the rideable waves were super infrequent. 

What are you supposed to do in this situation?
A) battle for the 3 or 4 waves an hour and take them for yourself 
B) settle for 1 wave an hour even though the other guys are outside you and probably won't make the take off 

I don't want to become the person who's just a total dickhead but it was also kind of frustrating just letting the only good wave of the hour go unridden"
3584,Got SMOKED by something in the ocean yesterday!,surfing,"
So I am in Central Florida and took the day off to catch what may have been the most manageable day of this massive Larry swell so far.. 



Waves were a little overhead at the cocoa beach pier and I was about 1 hour into my planned 4 hour session before work.. Here is my story:



Soooo, I caught a nice overhead left all the way to the inside (one hit wonder before the close out thumping of course)

Popped up out of the water and fucking BAM!!! Something hits the SHIT out of me in the head\\jaw face section (felt like i got freaking sucker punched in the jaw\neck area from a running start puncher!)!! I go back underwater thinking it was like a random surfer lost his board and it hit me in the face\\head! (As sometimes happens and has happened to me once before in my 20 year comeback)

So I pop up out of the water (holding my head\\neck checking if I'm bleeding anywhere) yelling wtf!?

I didn't see anyone else board...

MY BOARD is like 6 feet away from me still so wasn't my board either... 

I'm like WTF jut happened?!

A random surfer about 25 yards inside of me towards the shoreline yells at me ""WAS THAT A SHARK?!""

I go I don't fucking know, but that shit HURT!

I was waiting on him to paddle back out to the outside so I could ask more questions about what he saw or thought he saw..

but .. he never paddled back out!

It was about that time I realized it wasn't a shark but rather a crustacean from the protozoic era.

It patted me on the back and said ""I need about tree fiddy"" 


Has anyone ever had this experience before Bros!? It was like a major wipeout

When I was like 10 I used to ""skimboard"" with my cousins but stopped rather quickly when one day while I was following my big and crazy couz', I saw him open his bare foot on all the side on a small rock (as I remember it). 🥶 daunting.

BUT STILL, it looks **SOOO FUN**, and I'm really eager to try again at 36yo, and was wondering if fiber boards were safer these days compared to custom made wood boards?

If you tried lately, I'm really curious what you have to say about this.

Thanks for reading."

I was thinking Puerto Rico (Rincon area) or Costa Rica (Tamarino area)? I'm not used to reef breaks at all. Mainly only whitewater when I go surfing because the waves are always close outs.

hey surf lords,

I started making a 2D surfing game because I don't get enough real life waves these days and none of the existing ones have really hit the spot for me. I would love to get some thoughts, opinions and insights from some giant kooks before i push onward. Here's progress a couple months in:

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing video 3j1yr9twce281...*

Very early WIP - but the idea is to have free surf modes, lots of silly arcade features and a big epic story mode (think Pokemon but instead of collecting monsters you're getting tubes). Would you guys be into something like this or am i being ridiculous?"

3641,"First surfboard after lessons, buying in Europe",surfing,"Hey,

I'm new to surfing, after 7 lessons in my local surf school I've enjoyed very much the experience, enough to be willing to invest in the material, looking for some feedback from Reddit. Unfortunately in my country the used deals are really bad (either the price is good but the material is in very bad shape, either the material is in a good state but price is almost identical to buying new).

For the wetsuit I bought yesterday the new generation of Deeply Explorer 4/3 (beach nearby has cold water); I received excellent feedback on their lining and the chest zip, with the Black Friday discount and a 10% code I think it was a good deal (185€).

For the surfboard is where I'm much more divided. I'm going to surf with my brother, we both made the surfing lessons together so we at least have that flexibility of trying different boards and see what works best (if need be we can always sell one of those later). A friend of him recommended a Torq one due to being much more resisting material and more easy to maneuver, and that while the transition would be more difficult early on (size and volume), it shouldn't be that hard and would be better long-term. On the other hand, they're much more expensive.

The surfboard that the friend recommended was a TORQ 7'2 MOD FUN BLUE SOFT DECK ROUND TAIL - COLOR FUTURES 7FT2, with Volume of 52 L, for the price of 380€. Do you think that would be a good option? He made that recommendation based on my brothers height and weight, which is fairly similar to mine (1.72m, 62kgs, he's 1.78m, 68kg).

For the 2nd surfboard, we're thinking of buying a cheaper one from Decathlon, more similar to the ones we tried on the surf school, one of those in foam. For our height and weight, do you guys recommend any specific one (or a specific size and volume)?

Thanks!"

For the next month, I am staying in Indonesia and can surf every day which I really want to make use of to improve my surfing, so I would really appreciate any feedback or critique.

Things that I notice right away are the ""poo stance"" which I need to work on, as well as not turning my upper body properly when attempting turns.

Hope everyone on north shore is scoring! I've been living and surfing in town since March of this year and currently experiencing the first flat spell. during this time are my options limited in terms of where to surf? I am only asking this because my skill level isn't quite ready for the north shore swells, biggest I've been out at Rockpiles in town was probably 6ft and even though I did catch a few waves, there were times I felt like I was defiantly out of my comfort zone (nothing like being out of position and seeing a massive wall of water coming at ya). I have surfed chuns, turtle bay, and kammies and had super fun waves but only forecasted at like 3-4.

Are there any spots up north that are ""easier"" when the swells are big or not really? how's the west side like tracks, pretty chill over there?

&amp;#x200B;

my theory is that my clammy hands have the surface area of like 500 cat tongues and its like he's getting groomed by 500 cats at once so he basically just jizzes himself mentally and can't handle the sensation. the reason i think this may be the root cause is that the clammy hands seem to pick up a lot of hair as i pet him, since it kind of sticks on his fur as you drag the hand across.

I’m looking to go on holiday or potentially even move to a place near the ocean where I can go surfing without needing a car to get to the spots. I don’t have a drivers license so I really need to be able to get to the spots by foot (ideally) or bicycle.

3756,AITA for not pulling off of a wave to avoid hitting someone when i thought they would move?,surfing,"Hey guys, yesterday i was surfing, i got into a wave, some dude dropped in on me but i kept going anyway as i thought there was enough room to still do a few manoeuvres. Out of no where i hear ""oi, what the fuck are you doing?"" And i see someone in the water on his board and i was B lining straight for him, there wasn't any room to bottom turn around him so i sat on the highest point of the wave thinking he'll just duck dive (which he did) and no one was hurt.

But then he started talking mad shit about people these days are such kooks and have no respect going off his trolley, i can't help but feel like it was up to him to move out of the way and i gave plenty of space to do so by being at the high point of the wave. He was definitely skilled enough in his duck dive to get under me so i don't see the issue. 

I paid no mind to his comments, just kept surfing and having fun because, well, shit happens and i wasn't intentionally trying to kill someone. But am i in the wrong for not pulling off the wave and wasting what little wave i had? 

I was always taught if someone is coming towards you to duck dive into the whitewash not the face off the wave so that you don't burn the guy surfing. 

So AITA?"

3759,Has ocean water ever made you throw up? I’m a surfer with emetophobia,surfing,"I have a stupid question - well maybe it’s not stupid - anyway please don’t judge me for it!

I have very very severe emetophobia (fear of being sick). It can be debilitating and get in the way of me doing things that might end up with me or someone else being sick, for example going out drinking. 

I learned to surf at The Wave, Bristol (the wave pool here in the U.K.) 6 months ago and have reached a good level for 6 months. I have never surfed in the ocean! I really really really want to go surfing in the ocean. 

The thing is, last time I went in the ocean (Watergate bay, Cornwall) I became immediately unwell with what seemed to be a stomach bug and it seemed like it was from the water because there weren’t any other explanations. I couldn’t cope if this happened again, it is my absolute nightmare situation. 

So basically, because my phobia causes me anxiety and I want to enjoy surfing in the ocean without getting sick from the water, my question is has anyone ever thrown up because of the ocean water? And how can you avoid this? How likely is it? Is sea water polluted with bacteria etc? Is it the salt??? Can swallowing salty ocean water by accident make you sick?

Thank you so much and I hope no one thinks I’m crazy haha!"

Could you please enlighten me about the sensation of going up a wave face?
In my progression I’ve only performed bottom turns so far and am working on going up the face to perform a top turn.

I was surfskate practicing up a big wide ramp (as if it was a wave) earlier and found it pretty difficult to pump up to the top of the ramp. So I guess my main question is — as physics go, does it also require a fair bit of effort to get to the top of a wave? Or does the motion of the wave (water traveling up then rolling over) kind of help “propel” you towards the top?

I appreciate it ! Will try more when the swell picks up. Thanks!"

I tried to get a few different surf rack set ups for my van but with back orders I was unable to get anything in time. ( my roof rack is covered in solar ).

For a temporary solution while I wait for a rack , I was considering using cam straps and creating a sling using my roof rack that would hang down the side of the van. The board would sit in the sling then I was going to use 2 or 3 ratchet straps to hold the board onto the van. Is this a horrible idea ? I will not be driving over 65 and most of the time will be driving slower than that.

I worked as a raft guide last summer and have experience with cam straps and ratchet straps and logically this seems like it would work . However I am unfamiliar with physics and surfboards so wanted to get a few other options.  Thanks in  advance!"

The Northside was more busy. A few people were shooting from north to south side. There were a few I could have taken but it may have been considered a drop in if I did. Wondering what people here think. Imo it would only be considered a drop in if you clearly saw someones intent early on to shoot. Otherwise it's fair game since the pylons make it mostly an occasional thing.

3870,Anyone surf while pregnant?,surfing,"Just found out I’m pregnant! I’m married and 30 so it’s welcome lol. I haven’t even had my first doctors appointment yet but I’m wondering in the meantime time can I surf still? I’m thinking if I only do low consequence, long board waves it should be fine? I’m very competent in the water and In Hawaii I used to see women with baby bumps in the line up all the time (haven’t noticed any yet on the mainland though). My best friend had a baby last year and she  didn’t surf, but she said it was because she tried and had so much anxiety about it in the water she decided it wasn’t worth it. But her doctor was also a surfer and she told her it was fine, to just stick with smaller days and conditions she’s confident she can handle. I always assumed when I got pregnant I’d be changing my risk level and style for awhile but would be surfing as long as my belly would allow me to paddle for lmao. But my family is treating me like I’m out of my damn mind for wanting to surf still. Any surfing mommas in here? What did you do when you were pregnant?"

3892,Went surfing at Pismo Beach,surfing,"Pretty new to surfing and recently bought a 6’ short board for super cheap. I’ve only surfed twice before so I was a bit nervous about trying the short board since people usually don’t recommend one for beginners. When I got out to the water, I was struggling HARD for a bit, but once I got the feel for it I was able to start trying to catch some waves. It was a train wreck for a while haha. I never learned how to pop up so I was just trying whatever seemed natural. After a while, I analyzed what other surfers were doing and incorporated their technique to whatever the f I was doing. Eventually, I GOT THE HANG OF IT. I started with popping up onto my knees. Once I felt comfortable, I started standing up on one foot and eventually stood up completely! I still have a long way to go, but I feel like I learned how to properly pop up and how to read the waves a lot better! It was a lot of fun doing trial and error, and afterwards you bet your ass I smoked a fat doobie! 

I was only out there for 2 hours so I’m hoping next time I can catch some bigger waves. Any tips other than not using a short board? Lmao Also, as a background I’m 21, 5’11, and an avid snowboarder/skateboarder."

I heard someone say once that they keep glucose tabs in a bag in their wetsuit, but I don't know if that's a thing lol.

Also, bonus question - Since I have to bring a bag every time I go bodyboarding to carry sugar and stuff, how should I make sure nobody steals it? I saw someone try to take it once but I ran up and took it from them.

3916,Wetsuit Fit Advice: Between sizes on Feral Wetsuit,surfing,"Trying to decide which Feral 3mm+ hooded suit to keep. I'm 6'1"", 155lbs and fall between sizes for M &amp; MT suits with Feral:

M 5'8""-5'11"" 150-170lbs

MT 5'11""-6'2""165-180lbs

I've tried both on and am torn which to go with. The M fits tighter through the legs and body, feeling perhaps a bit restrictive through the chest / shoulders (since the shorter torso pulls downwards on the shoulders a bit more). Arm length is okay, legs come up a little bit, sitting \~ 2"" above ankle bone (I do normally wear booties, so maybe length here isn't critical). The MT fits more comfortably, not feeling as tight at knee joints and shoulders, but has a bit more material under arms and if I try, I can manage to grab a fold on lower back. Also gets a couple stomach folds if I'm sitting upright.

&amp;#x200B;

Both are generally comfortable, but I've read that you should air on the tighter side, since it will loosen up when wet / after break-in. Curious what folks experience have been with Feral suits on the water and if I should be concerned on legs being a bit short / shoulders being a bit restrictive when trying on dry. Any guidance is appreciated. Thanks!"

I'm in a bit of a dilemma and I was wondering how people are coping with mental health when surf is far away/not regular enough?

I've recently relocated, sadly away from the coast due to work and university commitments. I'm struggling to transition from being able to surf 3-4 times a week to only going once every 4-5 weeks due to long drive, busy work schedule and inconsistent surf.

29 year old city boy for most of his life. On vacation at a beach town (Byron Bay, NSW), decided to say fuck it and take some surf lessons.


Tuesday session was heaps of fun but rough as shit. Got caught in a lot of rips but still managed to pop up on my board a few times using the back-foot 2 front-foot method.


Then today the instructor was like “just try popping up all at once”. Ended up catching at least 9-10 waves (4-5 were considered good ones according to the instructor) and achieved a high comparable to taking molly. 


So yeah, just wanted to tell someone. There are beaches about 30-50 minutes from where I live, hopefully I can go down every second weekend and start surfing more consistently.


I don’t want to jump to conclusions at the moment and come across too strong, but I have found a new love and passion in life and I will die trying to perfect this art form!"

3980,...Lost Sub Driver 2.0 sizing question,surfing,"I found a great deal on CL and thinking of pulling the trigger on a 6.2 x 20 x 2.5 33L Driver 2.0. Worried the volume might be too low, but I'm definitely trying to size down from my current board. 

I weight 185 lbs (84kg) and I'm 6'1(185 cm). I surf on average 2-4 times a week. Haven't always been as consistent, but I've been surfing in SoCal for 13 years, including trips to Bali, Costa Rica, MX, Japan and NorCal. I can handle waves up to 12 feet, as well as (certain) barrels and late drops, but I'm not doing airs or any of the more ""progressive"" moves. 

I used to have a 6'4 x 19 late 90s knifey shortboard and hated it. Switched to a 6'5 x 20ish model, which I rode for years, until I broke it. Most recently my go to has been a Surftech Soul Fish 6'6 x 21 x 2.5 37-38ish L which I love on point breaks but it feels too beefy and long for fast/closing out beach breaks. Since I ll be surfing a lot of these beach breaks this winter, I wanted a board that can handle that, but not a groveler (I just use a longboard or foamie on those days)

So I wanted to get something smaller than my 6'6 but without going into the fish end of the range and without buying a HPSB per se. For bigger waves, I have a 6'8 step up and a 7'6 semi gun so not worried about a board that can handle those conditions.

3992,How do you ask someone out in the water?,surfing,"I had a pleasant surf midday and there were a few girls out (group). Chatted with two of them at random times paddling against the current. Both were beautiful and surprisingly chatty with me. More chatty than the average dude ever is… Is there a good way to ask a girl out in the water? My guess is they were in their late 20s… I’m in my early 30s. My memory would struggle to remember a phone number… maybe make water proof business cards? Curious to hear guidance on this topic as this has happened once before, but today I really wanted to ask one of them out. Would like to be better prepared should this ever happen again."

3997,How did hip surgery affect your surfing?,surfing,"I'm 24 and have to get surgery on both of my hips. I'm wondering how hip surgery affected your surfing? Also, while in recovery, were you able to bodyboard or stand up paddle at some point?

I was landlocked for the past 6 years and after spending the whole of 2020 surfing I was at a point where I was finally satisfied with my surfing and I'm kinda terrified of how much my post-op surfing will suck"

I got my money back. I had to do some instagram investigating but I was able to track roar down and he refunded me the money. I am on the fence if I should keep these posts up or not...I will adhere to the poll results.

From what I was told, roar hasn't had the best luck recently, but I don't think I can entirely excuse how things played out because if i had NOT made these efforts, its clear to me that he would have never paid me back. Seems like he has good people around him though. The internet is quite an amazing place. Thank you to the kind strangers who saw my post and helped me out. 

Surfs up!

I'm particularly stoked to get this mat out in the water. Been wanting to ride one for a long time but they're kind of expensive so it's a big leap of faith to try one out if you can't borrow one.

Are you mat curious and would you ride one given the chance? If you are a believer, please sing their praises below."
